            <editorialDecl>
                <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
                <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
                <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
                <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
                <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
                <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
                <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
                <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
                <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                    <head type="sub">Concerning Poſtures and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Armes.</head>
                    <p>
                        <seg rendition="simple:dropcap">T</seg>He firſt rudiments for the Diſcipline of Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ought to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, for the well mannaging of their Armes; whereby they may be brought, to uſe them with eaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: whereas to the contrary (without exerciſe) both ſorts of Armes, wil become a troubleſom burden, unto the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Bearers. No man is borne a Souldier, neither can any attain, to be kilfull in the Art Military without practice. But by practice is gained know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, knowledge begets courage and confidence; few or none being fearefull to execute what by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1160:15"/>
frequent practice they have throughly learned.</p>
                    <p>Wherefore it is neceſſary for every one that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends any proficiency in this part of the Art mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, to be inſtructed in the Poſtures and well handling of their Armes; a thing much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired in our Trained Bands, though ſmall hope of amendment. Seeing the Souldiers are ſcarce cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth to exerciſe either Poſture, or Motion once in foure or five yeares. Whoſe the fault is I know not, only I pray God that it may be ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, leſt ſhame and infamy be the leaſt of euils which our careleſſe ſecurity may bring upon us: Yet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this digreſſion, for my zeale to my Countries good had almoſt tranſported mee beyond the bounds of my intent, but of this no more. I will now come to the poſtures of the Musket and Pike: which, I conceive, are fitteſt to begin from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of their Armes, and arming the Souldiers concluding them with the laying down of their Armes, or diſarming them. But before I begin the Poſtures: Mee thinks I heare ſome already inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what is a Poſture. Wherefore that I may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them, and not be troubleſome to others. In briefe thus.</p>
                    <p>Poſture in a Souldier is the garbe or figure, that he uſeth in the handling of his Armes, conſiſting of ſeverall Motions for atchieving of each Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. The Motion being the working part, the Poſture the alteration or act, either in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or matter. As to reſt your Musket being one Poſture, to ſhoulder your Musket another, ſo likewiſe for the reſt, howbeit ſome perchance will
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1160:15"/>
object, (as formerly hath bin to one of <hi>Athens,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a long Oration in the praiſe of <hi>Hercules</hi> his valour) who ever doubted of it. So to me who ever queſtioned theſe for Poſtures: yet I have known them not only queſtioned, but written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, peremptorily concluding that there are but three Poſtures to be uſed for the Musket, whoſe errours I ſhal eaſily confute. But more of this after the Poſtures of the Musket. Wherefore for the more orderly proceeding conceive their Armes to lie before them on the ground, and then the firſt command will be, to ſtand to their Armes.</p>

                        <p>There is likewiſe the Sentinell Poſture, which is, The Muskettier having his Musket charged with Bullet, his Match cockt, his Pan guarded, ſtands with his Musket reſted to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1160:17"/>
ſuch duty as ſhall be commanded or given him in charge. Some have likewiſe taught to make ready on, or from the Sentinell Poſture: But note that as none comes to ſtand Sentinell but comes ready charged: So if any occaſion happen that he muſt give fire in the time of his ſtanding Sentinel, it cauſeth a generall Alarme. So that he will have no fit time to make ready upon his Reſt: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I conceive it ſuperfluous; but will ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to better judgement.</p>
                        <p>We have alſo the Funerall Poſture, which from the Reſt is to be performed at 3. Motions, which cannot ſo well be expreſt in writing, as it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it ſelfe in Action. Wherefore ſeeing that it is rather an Ornament to Obſequies, than truly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Armies I will not ſpend more time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, but come to the Poſtures of the Pike. Yet before I paſſe upon them, give me leave to anſwer ſome, which out of a Criticall humour will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be carping at others, condemning theſe Poſtures, ſaying, There are more by halfe, then are either good or uſefull; and that there are no more Poſtures to be uſed, but Make ready, Preſent, Give fire. The which wee will not deny that in Service there are any other uſefull: notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I would have them to know, that Make ready is no Poſture, but a word of Command, including all Poſtures, from the firſt Arming of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to the preſent: or if the Muskettier be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſhouldered or both, then the word (Make ready) commands the proſecution of the reſt of your Poſtures which are between the Poſture
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1160:17"/>
you then immediatly are at, when the word is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the other Poſture, Preſent for which reaſon when wee teach Muskettiers at firſt it is moſt neceſſary to inſtruct them punctually, from Poſture to Poſture: Which being once attained, he manageth his Armes more ſurely more come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with more celerity, and with better execution: and at the firſt may as eaſily be taught the beſt way. But if he have got an habit of doing ill there wil be as much or more pains ſpent in reclayming his errours, as at firſt to teach him the beſt, ſafeſt, and readieſt way.</p>

A File<note place="margin">What is a File.</note> is a ſequence of men, ſtanding one behinde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, backe to belly in a ſtraight line from Front to Reere, conſiſting ſometimes of 6. 8. or 10. men. on ſome occaſions the <hi>Spaniards</hi> make them 12. deepe. But when any one would ſhew much varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of exerciſe, then 8. will be the more pliant and dividual number, yet for ſervice in the field, where men are not altogether ſo expert (as I could wiſh our Country-men were) 10. men is the fitteſt number, not onely for the cauſe aforeſaid, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe that 10. is the ſquare root of a 100. and is a better number to draw Companies into groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer bodies.</p>

Wherfore becauſe that Files are firſt to be drawn forth, and that by adding or joyning of Files to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Rankes are made; we will begin firſt with Files.

                    <p>It will not be of it ſelfe ſufficient that I have both marked and figured the places and dignities to each particular man in his File and Ranke, but it will be looked for of ſome, that I ſhould backe my opinions either with ſound and good reaſons of mine owne, or at the leaſt with the opinions of ſome others: as for ſuch as have employed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon this ſubject, they have been as divers in their judgements, as their number, each man having a fancie to his owne way.

orderly diſcipline, conſider that all parts of the body ought to be anſwerable. Wherefore ſeeing that the joyning of Files and Rankes produceth greater Bodies; it is neceſſary that a true proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be kept from the beginning: and that in drawing forth of Files they obſerve to make the Reere halfe files anſwerable in skill and worth to the Front halfe file. And that the file-leaders, and halfe-rankes of the left flanke, ſhould be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in worth, skill, and valour to the right flanke, that the Reere diviſion hold like proportion with the Front diviſion, and that all parts of the body <figure>

                        </figure> be ballanced with true proportion, ſo neere as the knowledge of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the number of the men will give you leave; and that there may be correſpondency in their worth, place, and dignity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you may obſerve by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the figures of number together, which are in the Margent, where you ſhal finde that the dignity being added together of the Front halfe file, makes the number of 18. And the worth of the Reere diviſion being in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner added, makes the like number. So likewiſe ſhal you finde the dignity and worth of the File leaders of the left flanke, to paralell the worth of thoſe on the right flanke by the ſame rule. If you will have it yet more cleere, obſerve that the file leader is the chiefe in his File, the bringer up the ſecond, the halfe File leader the third, the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1160:22"/>
laſt man of the front halfe file the fourth. Now note that as the worth of the firſt precedes the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, ſo the worth of the third exceeds the fourth. Now adde the firſt worth to the fourth worth, and that makes five. And the ſecond worth to the third, and it makes the ſame number; ſo that there is equalitie throughout the Battell both in Front, Reere, and Flankes: for it were unreaſonable, that all the chiefe men ſhould be on the right Flanke, and all the worſt on the left. For the left muſt be oppoſed to the enemies right. The File leader ought to be worthieſt, becauſe he hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his File, and marcheth the firſt againſt his enemy. The bringer up ought to be the ſecond, becauſe his place of march is in the Reere, and is in moſt danger, ſhould the enemy charge on that part. The halfe file leader is the third in honour, becauſe that when the halfe file is taken off upon any occaſion, he is the leader (unleſſe they be commanded to face about) the laſt man of the front halfe file is the fourth man in dignitie, for when the Reere diviſion is taken off, then he is the Bringer up. The next man to the file-leader hath the fift place of honour, for that one doubling brings him into the front. The next man before the Bringer-up hath the ſixt place of honour, for that if the body be faced about, one doubling brings him into the Front accidentall, or keeping the proper front by once doubling of rankes, he becomes Bringer-up to his File-leader. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth place of honour is his that marcheth next after the halfe-file leader, for that when the halfe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1160:23"/>
files double the Front, or marcheth forth, then one doubling, ranks him even with the Front. The eight and laſt place of honour, is his that is the third from the Front, the File being but 8. deepe, which may alſo be made a File-leader, though with more trouble than the reſt: for by counter-marching Front and Reere into the middeſt, and then facing to the former front, &amp; after doubling of ranks, makes him likewiſe a file-leader. Now as every mans dignitie is more or leſſe in his File, ſo is all his ranke with him. Wherefore this that hath already beene ſaid, may ſuffice to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate unto thoſe which as yet are ignorant of the ſeverall places of dignity, both in Ranke and File. I might have enforced many other reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the dignity of number and place: but I have inſiſted longer upon this ſubject, then at firſt I intended, which makes me the more willing, though ſomewhat abruptly to breake from it, and come to ſhew the manner of joyning or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Files into forme of battell. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this may ſerve for all, the Serjeant that hath order to place them, is to lead them up according to their worth and honour. As firſt the right hand file; then the left hand file; and ſo the other files ſucceſſively within them according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall worths and places. As by the following figure you may more plainely perceive.</p>

Wherein the firſt thing we are to inſtruct them in, is their diſtances. But becauſe it is held by ſome a matter diſputable, whether diſtance be one of the motions or no: We will firſt declare what is diſtance. To which I anſwer, that indeed Diſtance it ſelfe is no motion, but there is motion in producing ſuch diſtance; for Diſtance is the ſpace of ground between man and man, either in File or Ranke, having relation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the place between each partie. All the reſt of the motions having not onely relation to the one, but the other. Wherefore not to ſpend more time in a matter ſo apparant, we will ſay that the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of a foot-companie conſiſts chiefly in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and motion. And therefore ſeeing that

diſtance is the ground of motion, and that no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be performed without diſtance, wee will leave to diſcourſe it, and fall to the matter it ſelfe, and ſhew how many ſorts of Diſtance is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in our moderne diſcipline, which are theſe foure here under named, <hi>viz.</hi>

When Files cloſe to the right and left, then they cloſe inward, taking their diſtance from the files within them, neerer to the middeſt of the bodie. Alſo note, that when Files are commanded to open to the right and left (or by diviſion) it muſt be outward. If

                    <p>It is not required that every Captaine or other Officer that ſhall exerciſe a Company, ſhall uſe all theſe ſeveral openings, and cloſings which are here expreſt, but rather that he ſhall make uſe of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, as he ſhall thinke fit for his preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or exerciſe.

                        </hi> To which I anſwer, That <hi>Facing</hi> is a particular turning of the Aſpect from one part to another, whereby the Front proper becomes a Front accidentall: And a Front accidentall, may be reduced to his proper Front. There are ſome likewiſe that by no meanes will allow of the word Face: Concluding it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unneceſſarie; And no other word muſt be given, but, To the Right, To the left, &amp;c. Yet I wonder that men will ſtumble at ſo ſmall a ſtraw, which cannot chuſe but be better uſed than refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For the word Face is but one ſyllable, and quickly pronounced, and gives ſo cleare an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the intent of the Commander that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it neceſſary. As for example, Should you command a Company to double Rankes to the Right, and then command them as they were, and then ſay, To the Left, it might puzzle a good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier at the firſt, to diſcerne whether he ſhould face

plainely perceive by the figure, where it is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as followeth. The eight or laſt ranke, which are the bringers up, paſſe forwards even in ranke, through or betweene the intervales, to the right of them that ſtand before them, until they come even in ranke with the Front; The ſeventh rank follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe which marched from behinde them, placing themſelves in the ſecond Rank, the ſixth in the third, the fifth ranke or halfe file in the fourth or reere of the front halfe file. This dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling maketh a very able Front, in bringing all the beſt Souldiers together. And although it hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed the number, in regard of the depth, yet it hath doubled the number in the length. This doubling is in quantity of number, not of ground. When you march into your places, remember this, that the Rank which laſt tooke his place in the execution of this motion, muſt firſt march into his place in the way of reducement. For as they are led forth by their Bringers up, contrariwiſe they are led off by their halfe file leaders.</p>
                    <p>In the doubling of the Front to the left by Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers up, it is the ſame, onely differing in this, that whereas before it was to the Right, this is to the Left. Wherefore let this ſuffice for doublings, by Bringers up.</p>

Some ſay it is good when a Commander will grace any, to bring them through the center or midſt of the Battalia. But you muſt note, if you have an odde File you cannot ſo punctually performe it, as when the number of your Files be even. The manner of the doubling, you may perceive by the Figure; The motion, by the little lines drawen from the Pricks. The performance is as followeth.</p>
                    <p>The outmoſt File of each Flanke ſtands; The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Files double into them; The third File from each Flanke ſtands; The fourth File double into the third; The ſixt into the fift, and ſo likewiſe for the reſt.</p>

This doubling our Rankes forward by our Halfe-files, is a Morio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> generally approved of by all for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, if it be done with conveniencie. It differeth from the other doubling by Bringers up, in quality, not in quantity, (for therein they keepe one propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:) In quality it differeth thus: The doubling by Bringers up brought the beſt and ſecond ſort of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers together into the Front; The fourth and third ſort into the Reere: So that the Reere was 4/7 worſe then the Front: This doubling by Halfe-files brings the beſt and the third together into the Front, and leaves the ſecond and fourth in the Reere: So that the Front is made more able, then the Reere, by ⅓. It differeth likewiſe in Motion thus; For whereas in the other doubling, by Bringers up, the Motion was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, by the laſt Ranke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every Ranke following the Ranke which came from behind him: This contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is directly led foorth by the fift Ranke from the Front, (if they be but eight deepe) and ſo is executed more ſurely and ſuddenly; the fift Ranke paſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the firſt; the ſixth Ranke into the ſecond; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth into the third, and ſo for the reſt. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement, when they are commanded to face about to the left, and march forth into their places; Then as the Motion was led on by the Halfe-file-leaders, ſo in the reducement, they are led off by the Bringers up: Doubling of halfe-files to the left produceth the ſame effect; onely the contrary hand.</p>

This doubling of the Reere, by the Front halfe-files, is to bee performed after this manner. The command being firſt given, the Front halfe-files face about to the left, (the Pikes being all aduanced, the Muskets all either poyſed or ſhouldred) and ſo being led by the Halfe-file-leaders to the Reere, which are thoſe that hold the fourth place of honour, they march directly forwards to the Right of the other part of the Body, which ſtood faced in oppoſition; untill the leaders of the doubling have ranked, even in Ranke with the Bringers up, the reſt ranking even with the other ſtanding Rankes, according to their places: If it be for ſervice that this doubling is uſed, then the whole body is to face about to the Reere, being the part to be doubled: If onely for exerciſe, then the Commander may (if he pleaſe) keepe his place, and the doubling being perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the whole Body faced to the Leader, command for the reducement; Files to the Right, double intire advancing; every man falling before his leader; which reduceth each man to his firſt place.</p>

Figure; The Motion is to be performed on this manner: The halfe-rankes of the Right, Face to the Right, and then Even in ranke together, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarch betweene the Intervales, untill the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt file to the Right, which is marked with the figure 1, be come into the outmoſt File of the left Flanke, which is marked with the number 16: The ſecond into the fifteenth; the third into the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth; The fourth into the thirteenth: and the reſt in like manner. The uſe of this doubling is, to ſtrengthen one of the Flankes, by bringing more hands, to doe preſent execution; the other Flanke being in more ſurety. The way for the Reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Motion is, after this manner; The halfe-ranks laſt doubled, being faced to the Right, then they which were the laſt, which tooke their places in the Motion, now are the firſt, which take their places in the Reducement; orderly marching in Ranke together, untill they come to their places: Then facing to their Leader, they become Files againe. The left flanke may in like manner, double the Right by Countermarch; The difference is this: The right Flanke ſtands, the left Flanke is inſerted into the Right, as before the Right was into the Left.

This doubling of halfe rankes is a more ſpeedy and ſure doubling, then the doubling of halfe ranks by countermarch, but is moſt commonly uſed when the body conſiſts but of one ſort of Armes, being either all Muskettiers, or all Pikes. But becauſe in my figures I have as well Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers as Pikes, I have made uſe of a Doubling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and from that have doubled my left flanke, to prevent the mixture of Armes: However mixture of Armes upon ſome occaſion may be neceſſary. The manner to performe the motion, is this. The left flanke ſtands, the halfe ranks of the right, face to the left; and then the inmoſt file of the right flanke, (all the files of the right flanke, being by this facing become ranks) is the leader of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, marching forth right to their left hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the intervales of the rankes of the left flank, untill that the ſixteenth file which now is become a ranke, have placed themſelves orderly in the two and thirtieth file, (which is the outmoſt file of the left flanke.) The fifteenth in the one and thirtieth, the fourteenth in the thirtieth: the thirteenth in the nine and twentieth; and ſo likewiſe of all the reſt. The places may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the figure. The doubling is of number, and not of place. For reducement to both theſe doublings, firſt cauſe the halfe rankes which laſt doubled, to face to the right, and ſo to march into their places. They that laſt tooke their places in the motion, are the firſt that take their places in the reducement. The doubling of halfe ranks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus reduced, next for the reducing of the halfe

great diſheartening of any enemy. Thirdly, it is very apt for over-fronting; being a doubling both of number and place. The way to performe the motion, is this.

For inſtruction how to performe this <hi>Motion,</hi> It is the ſame with the laſt <hi>figure;</hi> differing onely in this; That as in the other <hi>figure,</hi> all the whole <hi>rankes</hi> turned to the <hi>right,</hi> behind their <hi>right-hand-men:</hi> In this <hi>Motion,</hi> the <hi>left-flanke,</hi> (or <hi>halfe-rankes</hi> to the <hi>left)</hi> fall into the outmoſt <hi>file</hi> to the <hi>left:</hi> The <hi>halfe-rankes</hi> to the <hi>right,</hi> behind their ſeverall <hi>right-hand-men:</hi> as you may perceive in part by the <hi>figure.</hi> I have ſhewen the <hi>figure,</hi> in the manner of the <hi>action,</hi> not fully performed: The <hi>pricks ranke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,</hi> denoting the places, from whence they came: The Quarter-circles, ſhewing the way of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> The <hi>prickes file-wiſe,</hi> directing, or ſhewing their Places they are going too.</p>
                    <p>For <hi>reducement</hi> to the <hi>figure:</hi> it is no more then this.

This foregoing <hi>figure</hi> of <hi>Converſion,</hi> is of <hi>Rankes, wheeling to the right and left,</hi> or <hi>ranks ranking to each flanke by wheeling.</hi> It differeth from <hi>ranks filing,</hi> both in manner and matter. In the manner thus, Whereas in <hi>ranks filing</hi> to the right and left; the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>left-hand file-leaders,</hi> preſerve and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their places; and with that, their honours. In this <hi>wheeling by Converſion to the right and left,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe: the <hi>innermoſt file-leaders,</hi> become the <hi>outmoſt</hi> men in that pure where the <hi>front</hi> ſtood; the other <hi>file-leaders ranking even</hi> within them. Some men have called this, <hi>Rankes, filing by Converſion, to the right and left,</hi> but corruptly. For <hi>converſion</hi> alwaies produceth <hi>rankes,</hi> as I formerly ſaid: and <hi>inverſion, files.</hi> But their miſtake groweth from this, that when <hi>rankes wheele to the right,</hi> or <hi>right</hi> and <hi>left,</hi> then (ſay they) they by <hi>wheeling,</hi> become <hi>file,</hi> or <hi>files,</hi> which is a palpable <hi>miſtake.</hi> For when we have any <hi>command</hi> for <hi>wheeling,</hi> it is a <hi>maxime</hi> for us, to <hi>wheele our aſpects unto the hand or part na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> By which doing, we either become ranke, or rankes: and not files, as ſome have ſought former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to maintaine. One uſe, among many, for this <hi>motion</hi> is. It is the ſpeedieſt way for a great <hi>body</hi> (if they have their due diſtance) to <hi>give fire to one, or both flanks,</hi> that as yet I know of. The way to performe this <hi>motion,</hi> is as followeth. The <hi>right</hi> and <hi>left-hand-men,</hi> of every <hi>ranke,</hi> became the <hi>Hindges</hi> of the <hi>motion:</hi> the reſt of each ranke, <hi>whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by equall diviſion,</hi> to the right and left about, and above their right and left-hand Leaders, untill they become ranks to the flanks. As you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1160:67"/>
by the Figure, where the <hi>pricks</hi> denote unto you, the <hi>places</hi> they ſtood in before the <hi>moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> the <hi>quarter circles,</hi> ſhewing the <hi>way</hi> of their <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> themſelves being converted into two ranks, ſheweth the motion executed. I have onely <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> three of the rankes; for it would have taken too much roome, to have <hi>wheeled</hi> all the <hi>ranks.</hi> And it is eaſie by this that is ſhewne, to conceive the reſt. If you would avoid <hi>mixture of Armes,</hi> then place all your <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> either in <hi>Front,</hi> or <hi>Reere:</hi> or elſe <hi>wheele</hi> onely your <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and leave your <hi>Pikes, ſtanding.</hi> Or elſe it may be done; the <hi>body marching</hi> at <hi>length:</hi> the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> being in the <hi>front,</hi> and <hi>reere Diviſions.</hi> The <hi>word</hi> for the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement</hi> is; <hi>rankes, ranke as you were.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The eaſieſt way for the <hi>reducement,</hi> will be firſt for to <hi>face</hi> to the <hi>reere,</hi> and then to <hi>wheele backe</hi> into their places. Then, <hi>face</hi> to their <hi>leader;</hi> and they will be reduced as at firſt. Now we will come to ſhew the next <hi>figure</hi> of <hi>Converſion,</hi> which is of <hi>files</hi> converted into <hi>ranks</hi> by <hi>equall proportion.</hi>

                        <seg rendition="simple:dropcap">I</seg>N this <hi>Chapter,</hi> I intend to ſhew the <hi>manner, of files ranking by Converſion, in equall parts;</hi> which <hi>Motion,</hi> I have ſeene u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſome <hi>Commanders,</hi> at ſuch times as their <hi>Companies</hi> have been but ſmall, having not had above two or three <hi>files</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> upon a <hi>flanke;</hi> and being willing, to <hi>march forth</hi> their <hi>Companies</hi> in <hi>diviſions:</hi> And this, becauſe, that two a <hi>breſt</hi> would be ſomwhat improper (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were upon neceſſity, in ſome narrow <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage)</hi> and that three a <hi>breſt,</hi> is alſo ſomewhat with the thinneſt. Therefore to augment the <hi>front</hi> of their march, they have <hi>ſhartned</hi> ſomewhat of their <hi>depths,</hi> in each diviſion: by cauſing their <hi>files,</hi> to <hi>ranke</hi> foure, or five, according as their <hi>depth</hi> may be, when the <hi>Command</hi> ſhall be given. This <hi>Motion</hi> of <hi>Converſion,</hi> may alſo be uſefull for <hi>larger bodies.</hi> For if upon a <hi>March,</hi> you are to paſſe thorough ſome <hi>ſtreight,</hi> where not above foure or five, can <hi>march</hi> a <hi>breſt;</hi> and that being paſt thorough, you are to direct your courſe, to the <hi>right,</hi> or <hi>left:</hi> If

The way to performe this <hi>Motion,</hi> is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. The <hi>Command</hi> being firſt given (as aboveſaid) the <hi>right-hand-file-leader,</hi> leadeth forth his <hi>file:</hi> &amp; the <hi>three next</hi> men behind him, move forwards to the <hi>left</hi> of each other; untill they <hi>ranke even</hi> a <hi>breſt</hi> with their <hi>file-leader.</hi> The next <hi>foure,</hi> in like manner <hi>ranking</hi> to the <hi>left,</hi> make the <hi>ſecond ranke.</hi> The <hi>file-leader</hi> of the <hi>ſecond file,</hi> placeth himſelfe, next after him, that was the <hi>half-file-leader</hi> of the <hi>firſt,</hi> which now is become the <hi>right-hand-man</hi> of the <hi>ſecond ranke;</hi> the three <hi>next men</hi> behind him, making up of his <hi>rank,</hi> in like manner. And ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for all the reſt, untill the <hi>Motion</hi> be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. This converts each <hi>file,</hi> into two <hi>ranks;</hi> and brings all the <hi>proper file-leaders,</hi> and <hi>half-file-leaders,</hi> to make the <hi>outmoſt file</hi> to the <hi>right:</hi> the <hi>Bringers-up,</hi> both of the <hi>Front,</hi> and <hi>Reere-half-files;</hi> make the <hi>outermoſt file</hi> to the <hi>left.</hi> The <hi>figures</hi> of <hi>Number,</hi> which are on the <hi>left flanke</hi> of the <hi>figure,</hi> in which, the word <hi>file</hi> added to each of them, demonſtrate <hi>places</hi> of the <hi>firſt, ſecond, third,</hi> and <hi>fourth file,</hi> and ſo conſequently for all the reſt; according to their <hi>former ſtanding,</hi> and the <hi>places</hi> they now occupy, being <hi>converted</hi> into <hi>ranks.</hi> The <hi>letters f,</hi> and <hi>h,</hi> which are placed on the <hi>right flanke;</hi> ſhewes the <hi>places</hi> of thoſe, which were the <hi>file-leaders,</hi> and <hi>half-file-leaders:</hi> each of the <hi>propex file-leaders,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now his <hi>half-file-leader,</hi> next after him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have ſhowne this <hi>figure</hi> partly <hi>performed</hi> partly <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> and partly <hi>ſtanding,</hi> as before the Motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>

For <hi>reducement,</hi> of this <hi>Motion</hi> of <hi>files ranking,</hi> foure to the <hi>left:</hi> One way is, to cauſe your <hi>ranks to file,</hi> (or <hi>invert) to the right,</hi> which being done, <hi>Command</hi> every <hi>File-leader, to lead up his file to the left:</hi> and ſo every man will have his <hi>place:</hi> For another way, <hi>Face the whole body to the right, and command the File-leaders to march, and half-files to ſtand, and take their places:</hi> and then they are all <hi>reduced,</hi> onely the <hi>file-leaders</hi> of the <hi>right-flanke,</hi> are on the <hi>left;</hi> and the <hi>file-leaders</hi> of the <hi>left-flanke,</hi> are on the <hi>right:</hi> which is <hi>reduced,</hi> by any <hi>entire Countermarch, of ranke, or file.</hi>

Some will have the <hi>Lacedamonian,</hi> A Counter-march of gaining of ground: becauſe the <hi>Enemy</hi> appearing in the <hi>Reere,</hi> it makes a ſemblance of Charging or falling on. Others call it, A Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarch of loſſe of ground: becauſe it looſeth all
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1160:71"/>
that ground the <hi>Battalia</hi> ſtood upon; taking in ſtead thereof, the ground behind the <hi>Reere.</hi> There are others of opinion, That there are Counter-marches of loſſe and gaine, in either of them. All theſe are furniſhed with <hi>reaſons,</hi> to backe their <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi> But if I ſhould ſtand to ſhew their many and ſeverall reaſons, I might well be thought to be without reaſon my ſelfe. My opinion is; That taking the ground before the <hi>Front,</hi> is gaining ground: and that to leave the ground we ſtood on, to take the ground next behind the <hi>Reere,</hi> is loſſe of ground: And yet to take either, whereby there is advantage gotten, muſt needs be gaining. But where the matter it ſelfe is ſo indifferent, it were fondneſſe to ſpend longer time about it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore note, That <hi>Countermarches</hi> were of ancient uſe amongſt the Greekes many hundred of yeeres ſince, &amp; from them learned and practiſed, by many other <hi>Nations;</hi> and ſo ſtill continued unto this day. But as the <hi>Snow-ball</hi> by much rowling, becomes the greater: So, in like manner, theſe <hi>Counter-marches</hi> have received <hi>addition</hi> in all ages. So that the three originall ones are now become more then thirty accounting thoſe <hi>diviſionall.</hi> And yet are all of them fathered upon one or other, of the three kinds.

This <hi>Baſtard Countermarch,</hi> may not rightly be ſaid, to be derived from any one of the particular grounds of <hi>Countermarch;</hi> but rather, participating of them all: And yet conſidering it, as it is to be, it is different from them all: for whereas the other <hi>countermarches,</hi> of <hi>files</hi> in <hi>diviſion,</hi> although they bring the <hi>Front</hi> and <hi>Reere</hi> into the <hi>middeſt,</hi> yet the <hi>front-halfe-files</hi> continue ſtill, on the ſame part, and the <hi>Reere-halfe-files</hi> do not alter into the places of the other. But this, contrary to any other, of the <hi>diviſionall countermarches, transferres the front-halfe-files into the ground, or place of the Reere-halfe-files; and them, into the contrary part, bringing the file-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and bringers up, together into the midſt.</hi> The way to performe this <hi>Motion,</hi> is as followeth. The <hi>front-halfe-files face about,</hi> paſſing forwards to the <hi>right</hi> (being led by the <hi>bringers up,</hi> of the <hi>front-halfe-files)</hi> betweene the <hi>Intervalles</hi> towards the <hi>reere:</hi> The <hi>Reere-halfe-files</hi> at the ſame inſtant in like manner <hi>marching</hi> forwards, betweene the <hi>Intervalles</hi> on their right hands into the <hi>Front,</hi> untill the <hi>Front-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,</hi> have attained the places of the <hi>Reere,</hi> and they contrariwiſe, the places of the <hi>Front.</hi> For the <hi>reducement</hi> of this <hi>countermarch,</hi> do as much backe againe; Or if you would <hi>reduce</hi> it ſome other way, you may firſt make an <hi>intirc countermarch</hi> of <hi>files,</hi> and then <hi>countermarch front,</hi> and <hi>reere,</hi> into the <hi>midſt;</hi> for under two <hi>countermarches,</hi> it will not be <hi>reduced.</hi> Now I will paſſe, to ſhew <hi>diviſionall countermarches</hi> of <hi>Ranks,</hi> or <hi>Flanks;</hi> The firſt ſhall be <hi>Chorean,</hi> as in the <hi>Chapter</hi> following.</p>

The Muskettiers may <hi>fire</hi> on this figure, divers waies: though I onely intend to ſpeake unto two of them.

This done, the <hi>ranke</hi> of five <hi>Muskettiers, gives fire; wheeling off,</hi> in like manner, by <hi>diviſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                            </hi> ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that where the <hi>number</hi> is <hi>odde,</hi> &amp; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>wheele off</hi> by <hi>diviſion;</hi> there the greateſt number, alwaies goes to the <hi>right.</hi> And ſo, in like manner, the <hi>rankes give fire,</hi> ſucceſſively; and place themſelves after their <hi>leaders,</hi> as before. When all the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> have <hi>given fire,</hi> and are <hi>wheeled off;</hi> then <hi>charge Pikes,</hi> which will be fifteene in the <hi>firſt ranke;</hi> the reſt <hi>decreaſing,</hi> Having advanced your <hi>Pikes,</hi> your figure will ſtand like two <hi>wedges,</hi> with their poynts <hi>ioyned,</hi> as you may perceive by this Figure next following.</p>

                        <p>If you would <hi>reduce</hi> your men from this Figure, without <hi>firing,</hi> (your men being ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert) let the <hi>Muskettiers ſtand,</hi> and <hi>Pikes face</hi> to the <hi>reere:</hi> and ſo the <hi>wedges</hi> will ſtand <hi>faced</hi> in <hi>oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Next, <hi>command</hi> them to <hi>interchange ground:</hi> the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> advancing forwards, into the <hi>ground</hi> of the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and the <hi>Pikes,</hi> moving into the <hi>ground</hi> of the <hi>Muskettiers;</hi> and then by <hi>facing</hi> the <hi>Pikes</hi> to the <hi>former front,</hi> the <hi>body</hi> will ſtand in forme of a <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> againe.</p>

might fire twelve ſeverall wayes together. This notwithſtanding, I ſpare to ſpeake further to what may be done; and come to ſhew what I intend in it. Concerning this Figure, the waies to fire upon it, are ordinarily two. The firſt, when the Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers give fire, and then place themſelves in the <hi>reere</hi> of their <hi>owne diviſions</hi> of Muskets. The ſecond way is, after that they have fired, to place them in the <hi>reere</hi> of their Pikes: the Pikes maintaining the Muskettiers <hi>ground.</hi> The words of Command which produce the Figure, are as followeth.</p>
                    <lg>

                        <l>Then let the Commander goe into the midſt, (or Center) and face the whole Company to him: giving tm ſuch direction, as is meete.</l>
                        <l>Laſtly, being all faced about to the right, the body will ſtand like the following Figure.</l>

themſelves in the <hi>reere</hi> of their Pikes, each ranke <hi>moving</hi> forwards, and maintaining their <hi>leaders ground.</hi> The ſecond ranke, in like manner, is to fire, and to take their places after the Muskettiers, which fired and <hi>wheeled off</hi> laſt before them. The reſt, ſucceſſively, are to doe the like, untill all the <hi>ſhot</hi> have fired, and are <hi>wheeled</hi> away againe. Then let the Pikes <hi>charge,</hi> &amp;c. If any object, that it is <hi>dangerous to have ſo large diſtance betweene the fronts of each firing:</hi> then, if you have files enow, yo u may draw two or three files of each Arme; <hi>croſſe</hi> the <hi>diviſions</hi> from the <hi>Angle</hi> of one <hi>front</hi> to the other: and ſo <hi>facing</hi> of them <hi>outward,</hi> they will make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable good <hi>defence</hi> on thoſe parts, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Having <hi>given fire</hi> upon the <hi>croſſe battell,</hi> and brought your Muskets to the <hi>reere</hi> of the Pikes: if you would <hi>reduce</hi> them, <hi>paſſe</hi> into the <hi>midſt</hi> of <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the Figure, and <hi>face</hi> all (both Muskettiers and Pikemen) to you; and cauſe thoſe which were the <hi>flankers,</hi> to <hi>cloſe</hi> their <hi>diviſions.</hi> Next, <hi>wheele</hi> the <hi>fronts</hi> into the <hi>midſt</hi> of the two other <hi>diviſions:</hi> then move to the <hi>front proper,</hi> and <hi>face</hi> the whole <hi>body</hi> to you, and ſo you ſhall have all your Muskettiers in the <hi>midſt;</hi> flanked with Pikes.
