                <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <editorialDecl>
                <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
                <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
                <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
                <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
                <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
                <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
                <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
                <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
                <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wrought in every <hi>Regenerate</hi> Man. Indeed the <hi>Substance</hi> of one Soul is not Removed or Dissolved in <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and the <hi>Substance</hi> of an other Introduced, as the Jews fondly fancy'd.

                    </p>
                    <p>First, It is a REAL <hi>Change,</hi> that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Man</hi> has pass'd upon him. 'Tis not meerly a <hi>Relative</hi> Change; and so the Change in <hi>Regeneration</hi> differs from that in <hi>Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> In one there is a Change of <hi>Estate,</hi> in t'other a change of <hi>Temper.</hi> In <hi>that,</hi> the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin is Blotted out; in <hi>this,</hi> the the <hi>Filth</hi> of Sin is wash'd away. <hi>That</hi> is a <hi>Sentence</hi> on the Sinner; like that in 2 Sam.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000654_0014_0FA99EC32965DAC8"/>
12.13. <hi>The Lord hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not dy. This</hi> is a <hi>Filling</hi> of the Sinner; as we may read, Eph. 2.1. <hi>You hath he filled, who were Dead in Trespasses and Sins.</hi> Nor is it meerly a <hi>Nominal</hi> or a <hi>Notional</hi> Change: 'tis no Brain-sick Imagination. We have one picture of this Change drawn from <hi>Inanimate</hi> Things; in Isa. 55.13. <hi>Instead of the Thorn, shall come up the Fir tree, and instead of the Briar, shall come up the Myrtle-tree.</hi> We have another shadow of this Change, fetch'd from <hi>Animate</hi> Things; in Isa. 11.6. <hi>The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lye down with the Kid.</hi> In <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi> thus it is; the man varies from what once he was, as much as a <hi>Fir</hi> from a <hi>Thorn,</hi> as much as a <hi>Lamb</hi> from a <hi>Wolf</hi>! Thus, One of the Primitive Christians, after his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, being met by an Idolater of his old Acquaintance, had that Salutation from him, <hi>Ego Sum,</hi> Sir, 'tis <hi>I</hi>? whereupon he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>At Ego non sum Ego</hi>; But Sir, <hi>'Tis not I</hi>; I am not the man I was.

There is a marvellous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement</hi> now between God and Man; wherein though not the <hi>Essence,</hi> nor the <hi>Greatness</hi> of God, yet a Resemblance of His HOLINESS is in a blessed measure Communicated unto the man thus, <hi>Born again.</hi> It may be said of him, <hi>He is a man after Gods own Heart</hi>; he <hi>Likes,</hi> he <hi>Loves,</hi> he <hi>Lives</hi> after such a manner as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe unto all serious Beholders, a little of that <hi>Holiness,</hi> which is Infinite in the <hi>Holy One of Israel.</hi> Hence, a Regenerate man studies a most exact Conformity to the Example of the Lord Jesus Christ, and Attains very much of what he studies. As a Renowned Minister could say, <hi>When I am to Preach a Sermon,</hi> I <hi>set my self to think, How would Jesus Christ Preach, were He to Handle my Subject</hi>!

Can you not Read a <hi>Bible,</hi> as well as a <hi>Gazet,</hi> or a <hi>Romance</hi>? Can you not as easily go to a <hi>Sermon,</hi> as a <hi>Tavern</hi>? O be continually waiting, upon Wisdoms <hi>Lively Oracles,</hi> that so you may, <hi>Hear and Live</hi>! Said the Apostle, in 1 Cor. 4.15. <hi>In Christ Jesus, I have Begotten you, thro' the Gospel:</hi> so then, if the <hi>Gospel</hi> were always in your Eyes or Ears, 'tis Likely that you might be, <hi>Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Christ Jesus.</hi> The Breath of <hi>Satan</hi> was that which did corrupt you, and the

Breath of <hi>Jesus</hi> may now Amend you. 'Tis said, <hi>Where the word of a King is, there is Power:</hi> If then, you seriously set your selves before and under the <hi>Word</hi> of the Eternal <hi>King,</hi> it may have such a <hi>power</hi> on you, as to bring you home unto God. When two or three <hi>Scriptures</hi> were Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto <hi>Peters</hi> Hearers, they were soon; <hi>Pierc'd in Heart</hi>; and by the use of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> may you come to be as well, <hi>Chang'd in Heart.</hi> When <hi>Austin</hi> was call'd upon, <hi>Take up and Read,</hi> then the close of the Thirteenth Chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> whereto he was directed, proved the means of his Conversion.

The Cry of <hi>Reproach</hi> is, <hi>You that have a Bad Name, Look after a New Name; you that have your Names Trampled in the Mire of the Earth, see that your Names be Written in Heaven; and whatever else you may be called, make sure that you be called, The Children of God</hi>! The Cry of <hi>Bondage</hi> is, <hi>Look after the Redemption of your souls; Ask the Son of God that you may be free indeed; Get out of the Bond of Iniquity</hi>! The Cry of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> is, <hi>Lay up a Treasure in Heaven. Do you want food! Be concerned about the Meat which Endures to everlasting Life. Do you want Clothes? Be concerned about the Fine Linnen, which is the Righteousness of the Saints. Do you want a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling!

Be sollicitous for a Room in the Fathers House, where there are many Mansions</hi>!

It is the Direction of Heaven in Job 34.31.32. <hi>Surely, it is meet to be said unto God, I have born chastisiment, I will not offend any more. That which I see not, Teach thou me; if I have done Iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> A Theef on a Cross, Blaspheming the Lord, was indeed a very rueful sight; but every afflicted person remaining <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> is indeed such a sight. Again, have you not seen many <hi>Miseries</hi> upon Others also? Why, there is a Lesson given us by all those calamities, like that which the Historian tells us, was upon the Statue of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib, Let the spectator become a Godly person</hi>; that is, One Born again. When you see o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made the Monuments of Gods Anger, it cries to <hi>you</hi>; and there is thus much in the <hi>Cry, O that by Regeneration, you would secure yourselves, from the like indignation</hi>!

unto that <hi>Commandment</hi> of God, we have here a most compassionate <hi>Invitation</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by, <hi>Coming to Him,</hi> He means nothing more nor less than, <hi>Believing on his Name.</hi> The <hi>Feast of Tabernacles</hi> held in <hi>September,</hi> with an Anniversary Observation among the ancient Jews, Typically Represented the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, probably at that very time of the Year, first came to <hi>Tabernacle in Flesh</hi> among us.

                <p n="2">II. In Coming to our Lord Jesus Christ, we must seek and ask for the <hi>Whole</hi> of that <hi>Salvation,</hi> which He has to bestow upon us.

However, what is to be, <hi>The End of our Faith</hi>? 'tis to be, <hi>The Salvation of the Soul.</hi> Why then, Let us be sure therein to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound unto our selves, the Enjoyment of ALL that <hi>Salvation.</hi> As it was of old said, <hi>Is Christ Divided</hi>? so we must make no <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision</hi> of that <hi>Salvation,</hi> for which the Lord Jesus Christ is to be Sued unto.

                    <hi>Dividing</hi> of his <hi>Garments</hi>; and <hi>Believers</hi> on our Lord are as averse unto the <hi>Dividing</hi> of His <hi>Mercies,</hi> Well then, Let us ponder with our selves, what a <hi>Priest,</hi> what a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> what a <hi>King,</hi> our Lord-Redeemer is, and let us beseech Him, to Be such an One, and to <hi>Do</hi> all that is to be done by such an One for our Souls.</p>
                <p>Particularly, <hi>Atonement,</hi> is one of those things which we are to come unto the Lord Jesus for. We are to come unto Him, as He is represented in Psal. 110.4. <hi>Thou art a Priest for ever!</hi> He demands of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                    <hi>Art thou willing that I should be a Priest for thy Soul</hi>! and we must heartily consent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his being so; therewithal, saying like the Psalmist, in Psal. 119. 122. <hi>O be surety for thy servant for good.</hi> We must come unto Him, as unto, <hi>The Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world</hi>: Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him, as unto <hi>Him, That Loves us, and washes us from our sins in His own Blood</hi>; Come unto Him, as unto that Jesus who having made <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for us on the Cross, here below, goes up, and goes on, to make <hi>Intercession</hi> for us, at the Right Hand of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> above.

which we are to come unto the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus for.

                <p>Once more, Tis for <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Protection,</hi> that our Lord Jesus Christ must be come unto.

                    <hi>III.</hi> Coming to the Lord Jesus Christ, is a thing that calleth for the <hi>Whole Soul,</hi> and all proper motions of the Soul, to be engaged in it. As in Praising of God, it is the Rule, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.1. <hi>Bless the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me, Praise his Holy Name</hi>; so in coming to Christ, the same Rule is to be observed; <hi>It must be done with the whole Soul, and all that is within us.</hi> The mind, the will, the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and all the Powers of the Soul, are to be concerned in this <hi>Work of God.</hi> As now,</p>

Jesus Christ, we must Firmly <hi>Believe</hi> all the Discoveries and Revelations, which God has given of him; and we should come to the Attainment of the Apostle, in 2. <hi>Tim</hi> 1 12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him.</hi> We are to be well perswaded of the Excellent Qualities i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ost perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> that <hi>In Him there does all Fulness dwell.</hi> There are especially four perswasions which we are to Entertain, about our Lord Jesus Christ: or else we shall be <hi>Lame</hi> in our Coming unto Him. One is, <hi>That He is Able to Save unto the uttermost, all that Come unto God, by Him.</hi> A Second is, <hi>That there is none other Name under Heaven, given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, whereby we must be Saved.</hi> A Third is, <hi>That whosoever comes unto Him, He will in no wise Cast him out.</hi> A Fourth is, <hi>That he who Believeth, shall be Saved.</hi> All of these, must be Look'd upon as most <hi>Faithful Sayings</hi>; and we must be ready to venture all the Interests of our Immortal Souls upon them.</p>
                <p>Secondly, It is with a fervent <hi>Petition</hi> to the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are to Come unto Him. The posture wherein we should come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, is upon our <hi>Knees:</hi> and we should present
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:000654_0088_0FA99F48ABC95DA8"/>
our prayers before him, as did the leper, in <hi>Marc.</hi> 1.40. <hi>He came to him, Beseeching Him, and kneeling down to him.</hi> Tis in the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Petitioners</hi>; yea, and of <hi>Poor</hi> ones too, that we are to <hi>sue</hi> unto our Lord Jesus Christ, when we come unto him. As a <hi>Beggar</hi> Petitions for an <hi>Alms,</hi> or, as a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner</hi> for his <hi>Life,</hi> so are we to Importune of our Lord Jesus Christ; that He would be concerned for our good. The Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with which the miserable besought the healing miracles of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the days of His flesh, are to be imitated in the Requests which we should make unto Him for our Souls. We are to intreat of Him, <hi>Lord, I am so Blind, that I cannot see the things of my Peace; Help this Blindness</hi>! We are to Entreat of Him, <hi>Lord, I am so Lame, that I cannot Run the Way of thy Commandments; Help this Lameness</hi>! We are to intreat, <hi>Lord, I have a Soul grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously vexed with the Divel; O cast this evil Spirit out.</hi> Yea, we are to entreat, <hi>Lord, I am Dead in Trespasses and sins; O thou that canst Raise the Dead, Make my Soul to Live</hi>! This is fitt Language to visit a Jesus</p>
                <p>Thirdly, We must come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, with a Lively <hi>Dependence</hi> on him. When we come unto our Lord Jesus Christ, we are to Rely upon him for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of all that <hi>Blessedness,</hi> whereof

Hope in the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the Compassionate Jesus; for He will bring thee unto the Praises of God for ever.</hi> Like the ancient Psalmist, having first with bitter strivings pleaded before the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>O Lord, I beseech thee to deliver my Soul</hi>! then conclude, <hi>Return to thy Rest, O my Soul, for the Lord will deal bountifully with thee.</hi>

As for us, we <hi>cannot</hi> come unto the Lord Jesus Christ; altho' our Precious and Immortal Souls do justly lie at the Stake, if we <hi>Do not come.</hi> And we never shall <hi>Come</hi> unto the Lord Jesus Christ aright, until we do with much anguish of Soul, see that we cannot <hi>come</hi> or <hi>stir</hi> towards Him. Nothing renders men more Incapable of a due <hi>Coming</hi> to the Lord Jesus Christ, than a vain and a proud <hi>Opinion</hi> of a <hi>Free will</hi> in themselves, of it self able to Do this <hi>Good Work</hi>; Or than forgetting, <hi>That in all Salvation-work, it is God who works in us, both to Will and to Do, of His own good pleasure.</hi> 'Tis very unlikely, That God should give us the <hi>Faith</hi> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, unless we sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to that, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Faith is not of your selves, 'tis the Gift of God.</hi> It is not likely that God should bestow upon us the <hi>Power</hi> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, without making us to own that in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, according to the working of His mighty Power.</hi> It was hardly a stranger thing to see <hi>Peter</hi> walking on the Sea,, than to see a Sinner coming to the Lord Jesus Christ. O be sensible of this accursed <hi>Impotency</hi>! but at the same time see, that without the <hi>Grace</hi> of
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:000654_0091_0FA99F4BAC8E0568"/>
God we cannot so much as arrive to be thus far sensible. And yet there are two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Things from which we should not be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by discouraged.</p>
                <p>First, We are to <hi>Cry</hi> that God would help us to come. When we are advised of such a thing as that in <hi>John.</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come unto me, Except the Father which hath sent me, Draw Him</hi>: It becomes us then humbly and warmly, to make that moan unto him, in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.4. <hi>O Draw me</hi>! We cannot <hi>come</hi> to the Lord Jesus Christ, until we <hi>Turn</hi>; but how should we do <hi>That</hi>? That we may <hi>Turn,</hi> the way is to <hi>Cry</hi>; make that <hi>Cry,</hi> in Jer. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                    </gap>1.18. <hi>Turn thou me, and I shall be Turned.</hi> O Ly before the Lord, and mourn before him, saying, <hi>Lord, I perish, and it is Just I should perish, if I do not come unto thee; but yet I cannot come; a Stone may as soon fly to Heaven, and become a Star in Heaven, as I of my self come to my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Lord; O do thou then Help me to come, and so Grace, Grace, will have all the Glory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Secondly; Now <hi>Try</hi> whether God will not help us to come Attempt, I say; See, as the well-disposed man, at length got so far as in Marc. 9.27. <hi>To say with Tears, Lord, I Believe, Help mine Unbelief!</hi> So, see whether you cannot say, <hi>Lord, now at Last I come! Lord, now at Last, I can trust my
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:000654_0092_0FA99F4C6BBC9820"/>
Soul in thy Hands, for thee to make me Happy for ever.</hi> We find, that the man with a <hi>Withered Hand</hi> in Math. 12.13. when he <hi>Try'd,</hi> could <hi>Stretch</hi> it out; Even so, Let us <hi>Try,</hi> whether the <hi>Withered Foot</hi> of our Souls be not Cured by the <hi>Soveraign Grace</hi> of God; and whether we cannot come to what we never could of our selves come unto.</p>
                <p n="5">V. They that will come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, must Answer and Conquer all the <hi>Objections</hi> of unbeleef, against coming to the Lord. You may be sure that when our Faces are once Christ-ward, many <hi>Obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> will be cast before us, by <hi>An evil heart of unbeleef.</hi> But as the ways to the <hi>City of Refuge,</hi> were Exactly and carefully cleared, among the <hi>Israelites</hi> of old, so must we do what we can to clear out of the way those things that might hinder us, in <hi>Flying for Refuge to the Hope set before us.</hi> As now,</p>
                <p>Tis one objection of unbeleef, <hi>Thy sins are so Extraordinarily Circumstanced, that if thou shouldest come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, it is Impossible thou shouldest be welcome unto that Holy Lord.</hi> Let our Answer to this objection, be, <hi>that</hi> in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Jesus Christ came into the world to Save sinners, of whom I am Chief.</hi> 'Tis for <hi>Sinners,</hi> that our Lord is become a <hi>Saviour; They</hi> are the <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                            <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k Ones,</hi> whom He is a <hi>Physician</hi> for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                    <pb n="90" facs="unknown:000654_0093_0FA99F4DE9D336E0"/>
and the worse, the deeper, the older their <hi>Sickness</hi> is, the more will be His <hi>Glory</hi> in the Saving of them. Tho' we are <hi>Great Sinners,</hi> yet we may plead it with Him, that He is, <hi>A Great Saviour.</hi> 'Tis true, we have been <hi>Ready to sin</hi>; but it is said of God in Jesus Christ, <hi>Thou art Ready to Pardon.</hi> 'Tis true, we have <hi>sinned abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>; but it is said of our Lord, <hi>He will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly pardon.</hi> It was of old thrown upon Him as his Disgrace, <hi>He Receiveth Sinners</hi>; but it is his Honour, His Renown. His <hi>Blood,</hi> is, <hi>A Fountain set open for sin and for uncleanness</hi>; the most polluted Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture among us all, may have Recourse to that <hi>Open Fountain.</hi> And, as long as we are not come to be such Apostates, Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, and Persecutors, as to Hate the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, we may be sure that we are not fallen into the <hi>Unpardonable sin.</hi> Yea, if we are but <hi>Afraid</hi> of that Sin, 'tis a sign that we are not <hi>Fallen</hi> into it. He has already Received, not only to His <hi>Mercy,</hi> but also to His <hi>Kingdom,</hi> such as have been Guilty of the very same Sins, that now astonish our Consciences: He has Received a <hi>Menasseh</hi>; He has Received a <hi>Mary Magdalene.</hi> Is it the Sin of <hi>Uncleanness,</hi> that affrights us? Remember, By <hi>Faith</hi> Rahab <hi>the Harlot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished not.</hi> Is it the Sin of <hi>Thievery,</hi> that
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:000654_0094_0FA99F4DF6DF35F0"/>
affrights us; Remember, The <hi>Thief on the Cross.</hi> Yea, Murder, and the <hi>Murder</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ himself, did not put some out of Reach to the <hi>Mercy</hi> of that Blessed Lord.</p>
                <p>Tis Another objection of unbeleef, <hi>Thou art not so prepared for the Lord Jesus Christ, as that thou mayest without presumption dare to come unto him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>To this objection let us give <hi>that</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Lest him that is athirst, come, &amp; whosoever will, Let him take the water of Life Freely.</hi> What is the true <hi>End</hi> of all those <hi>Preparations</hi> that are undergone by the Elect of God, in their coming unto the Lord Jesus Christ? they are that we may be made <hi>willing</hi> to come. So then, if we do but find our selves <hi>willing</hi> to have the Lord Jesus Christ, we need not scruple our liberty to come unto him. Are we so affected with our <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as to be willing that the Lord Jesus Christ should be our <hi>Wisdom</hi>? Are we so concerned about our <hi>Guiltiness,</hi> as that we are willing to have <hi>Righteousness</hi> by our Lord Jesus Christ? Are we so troubled for our <hi>Pollutions,</hi> as to be willing that the Lord Jesus Christ, should be our <hi>Sanctification? Is</hi> our <hi>Captivity</hi> so Irksome to us, that we are willing to have <hi>Redemption</hi> by the Lord Jesus Christ? Then <hi>Come,</hi> in Gods Name; say not, <hi>Shall I?
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:000654_0095_0FA99F4EADC289E0"/>
May</hi> I? but, <hi>Come,</hi> without any further Hesitation. We must not imagine to come unto our Lord Jesus Christ, with any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation but that of our being <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and miserable, and poor and blind and Naked.</hi> It is not under the Notion of <hi>prepared,</hi> but under the Notion of <hi>perishing</hi> Sinners, that we are to come unto Him. We would fain come unto Him <hi>with,</hi> such and such good Frames in our Souls; but we are to come unto Him <hi>for,</hi> what we cannot come unto Him <hi>with.</hi> Never stand pausing, whether you have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone such Degrees of <hi>Compunction</hi> and <hi>Contrition</hi>; beware lest you make a <hi>Christ</hi> of those things; but if you <hi>can</hi> come, <hi>Do</hi>; or however <hi>Do</hi> what you <hi>can</hi> to come. Do not say, <hi>Lord, Depart from me, for I am sinful man</hi>; but say, <hi>Lord, because</hi> I <hi>am a sinful man, therefore</hi> I <hi>will come unto thee.</hi> Or argue at such a rate as the Lepers did, <hi>Be sure, if</hi> I <hi>sit still,</hi> I <hi>dy</hi>; I <hi>may go forth and live: If</hi> I <hi>stay from the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> I <hi>am ruined unavoidably; but</hi> I <hi>may come to Him, and have a good reception with Him: so this I'll do</hi>!</p>
                <p n="6">VI. Because we have hearts most unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably <hi>Lothe</hi> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, we should lay before our selves all sit <hi>Incentives,</hi> to Provoke us, and Excite us thereunto. Tis <hi>Prodigious</hi>; but yet it is <hi>Notorious</hi>; There is nothing in the world

                <p>Let our first Consideration be This: <hi>Who is it, that Invites thee, O my Soul, yea, who is it, that Requires thee to come unto Him!</hi> It is no Less an One than the <hi>King</hi> of Heaven, the <hi>Lord</hi> of Glory, and the <hi>Son</hi> of God.

                </p>
                <p>Let our next Consideration be, <hi>Shall</hi> I <hi>be a Looser by coming to the Lord Jesus Christ? No, shall I not.</hi> The Wise Man said, <hi>Of Labour there is Profit</hi>; but there is no <hi>Profit</hi> like that of this <hi>Labour.</hi> Let us come to our Lord; we shall find no mistake in that of the Psalmist, <hi>It is good for me to Draw near unto God</hi>! This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Lord Jesus Christ, is the most considerable Thing in that, <hi>Godliness which is profitable to all things.</hi> Come to the Lord Jesus Christ, and immediately, the God of Heaven will say to you, <hi>Be of Good Chear, thy sins are forgiven thee</hi>! Immediately the same God of Heaven, will say, <hi>This is a Dear Son, this is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Child, I will surely have mercy on him</hi>!

Ah, Rock indeed, that such a Motive will not break!</p>
                <p>Let our Third Consideration be, <hi>What will become of me, if</hi> I <hi>do not come unto the Lord Jesus Christ</hi>! Or, <hi>How shall</hi> I <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, if</hi> I <hi>neglect so great Salvation</hi>?

                    <hi>State of Probation,</hi> which our God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for us; and that we may be assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our <hi>Preparation</hi> for that GREAT WORLD, it is necessary that we should be furnished with some true Notions of it. But while we are <hi>Clothed</hi> with <hi>Flesh,</hi> the Notions of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Concerns, are most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily conveyed unto us, by <hi>Metaphors</hi> fetch'd from such Objects, as do by our <hi>Flesh</hi> become sensible unto us; and the Beams of <hi>Light</hi> must come unto us from that <hi>Other World,</hi> with some <hi>Clothing</hi> from this upon them. Now Almighty God, Condescending in His Instructions to our Capacities, has been pleased Himself, to Intimate and as it were to Consecrate, certain <hi>Metaphors,</hi> for the use of our understandings, in shaping our Conceptions of such things as otherwise would be <hi>Unutterable,</hi> and He has pitched upon diverse things of common and famous use in Humane affairs, giving us this Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereupon, <hi>Make those things the Figures from whence your Thoughts are to take their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, when you go to apprehend, the Deep things of God.</hi>

                <p>Among the Profound <hi>Mysteries,</hi> whereof our Merciful God has Mercifully advised us, One is, <hi>That Everlasting and Immutable Counsel of His, whereby He has Chosen a Certain and Special Number of Men, to be Vessels for the Glory of His Grace forever, with an Eternal Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation

passing over others.</hi> Now the Emblem or Shadow, under which our God would give us notice of this Glorious <hi>Mystery,</hi> is that of, A BOOK, wherein we may Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Entred, the Names of such as are to be Saved by the Lord Jesus Christ. Suppose a <hi>Daniel,</hi> a <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>John</hi> might on this Side the Third Heaven, have enjoyed a <hi>Vision</hi> of the Eternal Election, passing upon the Heirs of <hi>Life,</hi> that Election would not have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than under the Shape and Form of, A BOOK, represented unto them. And the mention of A BOOK, in this case, may be supposed an allusion to the Publick <hi>Registers,</hi> used in Cities, Countreys, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and with almost all the Civilized Nations of this World; where the <hi>Names</hi> of such as might have any claim to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Priviledges, are usually Enrolled.

that are to have <hi>Life,</hi> by the <hi>Death</hi> of our Lord, on that <hi>Cross, What I have Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I have Written; and it shall never be Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Least Obliteration.</hi> This was the Old <hi>Austins</hi> way of arguing.</p>
                <p>'Tis true, that <hi>Moses</hi> pleading for Sinful <hi>Israel,</hi> said, in Exod. 32.33. <hi>If thou wilt, Forgive their Sin, and if not, Blot me, I pray thee, out of this Book, which thou hast Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:</hi> I Insist not on that which many, and especially Jewish Interpreters, assign as the meaning of those words; That they refer to the <hi>Book</hi> of the Law, or the Pentateuch, where the Name of <hi>Moses</hi> does <hi>Live</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned unto all Generations; <hi>q. d.

Divine Election, is a Thing every where affirmed, by the Author of that Election; a thousand Scriptures conspire to tell us, <hi>That the purpose of God, according to Election shall stand.</hi> I Remember, that <hi>Solomon</hi> says, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.25. <hi>The Righteous is an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Foundation.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies this to all the <hi>Elect.</hi> They that have their Names <hi>Written in the Book of Life,</hi> have a two-fold <hi>Writing</hi> upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; One, <hi>The Lord knows who are his</hi>

thee, nor Forsake thee.</hi> All that have their Names in the <hi>Book,</hi> shall be Married un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord Jesus Christ; but our Lord says, <hi>I hate putting away</hi>! The <hi>Power</hi> of God, and the <hi>Promise</hi> of God, is Engaged for, <hi>The Perseverance of the Saints</hi>; and the <hi>Intercession</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, must be Unsuccessful, and Insufficient, if any of them should not at last come to be, <hi>With Him, where He is</hi>!</p>
                <p>In short, If any Name could be Really Blotted out from the <hi>Book of Life,</hi> it must be, either, because that God knows not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly who will come unto <hi>Life Eternal</hi> at the last, or, because God could not confer the <hi>Grace,</hi> which is Necessary to bring them unto that <hi>Life.</hi> But, it is fit, that such <hi>Pelagian, Arminian, Socinian,</hi> Blasphemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Abominable among the People of God.</p>
                <p>But then, a Second Assertion is,</p>
                <p>That a man, having his <hi>Name</hi> written in the Book of Life, may by a Blessed <hi>Assurance</hi> of it, be able to <hi>Read</hi> it there. Our Lord, said once unto His Disciples, in Luc. 10.20: <hi>Rejoice, because your Names are written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; and this is one of those things whereto He would have that Rule applyed, <hi>What I say to you, I say to all.</hi> So then a Disciple of Our Lord Jesus Christ on earth may with

Joy unspeakable see his Name written, <hi>In Heaven,</hi> among them that, <hi>For Heaven,</hi> at the last. Why are we enjoyned, in 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 10 <hi>Give Diligence to make your Election sure.</hi> 'Tis not a certainty of the <hi>Object,</hi> but a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Subject,</hi> that we are directed unto the pursuance of: A man by diligence in the Exercise of all vertue may come to be <hi>sure</hi> of this, <hi>I have my Name Written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Eternally Elected of God.</hi> The Inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable consequents of a <hi>Name written in the Book of Life, may</hi> be known by them, that have them. The <hi>Grace</hi> of God, wrought in the hearts of them that have their Names in the <hi>Book</hi> of God; this is a discernible sort of a Thing; tis compared unto <hi>Fire,</hi> unto <hi>Light,</hi> unto <hi>Life,</hi> which make themselves evident where they are. One Good man has before now been able to say, <hi>Lord, I believe.</hi> Another Good man has been able to say, <hi>Lord, thou knowest that I Love thee.</hi> Yea, but they that are assured of such Things, may readily tell, where their <hi>Names</hi> are to be found. Good men may come to say, as in 1: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3 14. <hi>We know that we have passed from Death to Life</hi>; and this knowledge may assure them, that they have <hi>Names Written in the Book of Life.</hi> It was the assurance of a <hi>Job, I know that my Redeemer lives.</hi> But such a man may be also assured, that his <hi>Redeemer</hi> has written him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:000654_0118_0FA99E8BB59A6D68"/>
them that are to be <hi>Redeemed. It</hi> was the assurance of a <hi>David, The Lord is my Shepherd</hi>; but such a Man may be also assured, that the <hi>Great Shepherd</hi> has written him, among the sheep of his <hi>Right-Hand.</hi> It was the assurance of a <hi>Paul, The Son of God has loved me</hi>; but he was then likewise assured of a Room in the <hi>Book</hi> as well as in the <hi>Heart</hi> of that Blessed Lord.</p>
                <p>And this brings me to that most Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant CASE. What should a Man do, that he may be <hi>Assured</hi> of a Name, Written in the Book of <hi>LIFE</hi>?</p>
                <p>The Roman Historian Reports, that the Son of a Senator, understanding certain Honours to be decreed by the Senate for certain Souldiers, whose <hi>Names</hi> were for that cause written in a <hi>Book,</hi> he begg'd of his Father to let him see the <hi>Book,</hi> or to tell him at least, whether his <hi>Name</hi> were in the <hi>Book</hi>?

                    <hi>The Book of Life,</hi> is One of the, <hi>Secret Things which belong unto the Lord</hi>; it were a vain and a mad curiosity, to think of Climbing Heaven for a view of <hi>That</hi>; we may say of it, <hi>I cannot Read, for lo, the Book is a sealed Book</hi>; but the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of them that may know their <hi>Names</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in that Book, These are the <hi>Revealed Things, which belong unto us, and unto our Children.</hi> Attend, then, while I set <hi>Them</hi> a little before you; Attend, while I show you, what is like to become of you through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Eternal Ages.</p>

But pray, mark what I say; the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, Inclines all that belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him, To prefer a Christ above a World; and to abhor and avoid every <hi>Sin,</hi> as the worst Evil in the World; It inclines them all, to prize <hi>Communion</hi> with God, in the Devotions of Christianity, above all the Delights of this Life: It inclines them all, to do all the Good they can, unto all that are about them. Say now, Are you Led by this <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of the Lord, or no? If you are, Then I say, That you are in the <hi>Holy Body</hi> of the Lord. Let me add, How are you concerned for the <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ?

This Blessed Martyr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accused unto the Council at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as a Contemner, yea, as a Blasphemer of their <hi>Temple Worship,</hi> he appeared before them with a <hi>Face</hi> full of Majesty, and an <hi>Heart</hi> full of Magnanimity, and in a grave Speech answered the Accusations.

                    <p>'Tis Peculiarly and Remarkably the Work of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> whereby Sinners are <hi>Converted</hi> unto God. There are <hi>Three Persons</hi> in the Adorable God head; Three Relative Properties, which we fitly call, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> We cannot indeed <hi>Fathom</hi> it, but yet we must <hi>Receive</hi> it, that there are those <hi>Three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistences</hi> in the Divine <hi>Essence</hi>; and indeed even the very <hi>first Line</hi> of the Bible point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at it. This is a Thing, which not the Light of <hi>Nature,</hi> but the Light of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> has Reveal'd unto us. If any ask, How we come to know this <hi>Trinity</hi> in God? I will answer, as <hi>Athanasius</hi> of old; <hi>Go to Jordan, and thou shalt see a Trinity.</hi> In Mat. 3.16, 17.

there at once discovered themselves. The <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> Tho' indeed a <hi>Trinity</hi> of persons in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, might from the Old Testament also be Evinced, unto the fullest confutation of the Blind <hi>Jews,</hi> who now deny the <hi>Mystery.</hi> Now, there is the Glorious Co-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of all these <hi>Three Persons</hi> in every Act of God, of which the Creature is the <hi>Object</hi>; yet there is a <hi>distinct manner</hi> of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to be ascribed unto each of them. Thus in the <hi>Salvation</hi> of a Sinner, the Work of <hi>Contriving</hi> that Salvation, belongs to God the <hi>Father</hi>; the Work of <hi>Effecting</hi> it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God the <hi>Son</hi>; But the Work of <hi>Applying</hi> it, belongs to God the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> And thence the <hi>Conversion</hi> of Sinners is that in which the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> has a special In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.

                    <p>There are many <hi>Methods</hi> by which the <hi>Conversion</hi> of Sinners is pursued by the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God. We read in Gen. 6.3. about the <hi>Strivings of the Spirit,</hi> There are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed <hi>Strivings</hi> or <hi>Labours,</hi> with which the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God is at work about the Souls of men.

                        </gap>ble before the Lord. But we should enquire what these <hi>Methods</hi> are?</p>
                    <p>First, There are <hi>External Endeavours</hi> used by the Spirit of God for the Conversion of men. As now; in the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God, there are Endeavours of the Holy Spirit for our Spiritual Good. The Spirit breaths and mov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                            <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s in the Appointments of the Gospel. As it was said in Neh. 9.3. <hi>Thou testifiedst against
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:000654_0147_0FA99EA46D4A5470"/>
them by thy Spirit in thy Prophets</hi>; The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God sends <hi>Prophets,</hi> Ministers, Messengers, with which he takes pains about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of ungodly men. The Prophet <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> could say, in Isa: 48.16. <hi>The Lord God,</hi> and His Spirit <hi>hath sent me</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why, when the Embassadors of God, <hi>are beeseeching of men to be Reconciled unto him,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>the Lord God</hi> himself, accompanys them, in their Embassages and in those Beseechings. Again by the <hi>Providences</hi> of God there are Endeavours of the Holy Spirit for our Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Good. The <hi>Mercies</hi> of God, those are the things with which the Holy Spirit is <hi>drawing</hi> us to Christ; it is in them, that the Spirit of God may say, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>With Loving Kindness have I drawn thee.</hi> The Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Spirit in every mercy is, <hi>O Fear the Lord and His Goodness!</hi> and, <hi>O let the Goodness of God Lead thee to Repentance!</hi> The <hi>Judgments</hi> of God, these are the Things, with which the <hi>Holy</hi> Spirit is <hi>driving</hi> us from Sin; for Them we may acknowledge to the Spirit of God, as in <hi>Job</hi> 10.2. <hi>Thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest with me.</hi> As the <hi>Rod</hi> has a <hi>voice,</hi> thus there is in every Judgment that voice of the Spirit, <hi>O Learn Righteousness</hi>! and, <hi>O see what an Evil and a Bitter Thing it is to Forsake thy God</hi>! In the Hand of the Spirit, <hi>Mercies</hi> do oblige, <hi>Judgments</hi> do demand our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Lord.</p>

                        <pb n="145" facs="unknown:000654_0148_0FA99EA52C7180A0"/>Secondly, There are <hi>Internal Endeavours</hi> used also by the Spirit of God for the Conversion of Men. And these are of two sorts.</p>
                    <p>First, the Holy Spirit attempts the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of men by <hi>Informing</hi> of them. He En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens them, and by their <hi>Illumination,</hi> they are made <hi>Partakers of the Holy Ghost.</hi> We are told, 1 Cor. 12.3. <hi>No man can say, that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</hi> The Holy Spirit perswades many a man, That the Lord Jesus is the <hi>Wonderful Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                <desc>•</desc>
                            </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> without whom, <hi>There is no Name given, whereby we may be Saved</hi>; The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> Enables many a man to <hi>Understand</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain</hi> the Fundamental Articles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thereby He makes their Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appear to be, as it is indeed, an Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Thing before them. 'Tis said of the Holy Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.18. <hi>He shall convince the World.</hi> He convinces them, that they have grievously <hi>sinned,</hi> and plunged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into innumerable <hi>Wants</hi> and <hi>Woes,</hi> by doing so; He convinces them, that a precious <hi>Christ,</hi> embraced by a penitent <hi>Faith,</hi> is the <hi>One Thing Needful</hi>; How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten does He Convince men, That there is a God, in whose <hi>Favour is Life,</hi>; that there is a <hi>Jesus,</hi> who <hi>delivers from the Wrath to come</hi>; that they must Rely upon the Lord Christ for <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:000654_0149_0FA99EA5F0316700"/>
                        <hi>Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> if they would be made partakers of true Blessedness? And this is that he may <hi>Convert the World.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secondly The Holy Spirit attempts the Conversion of men by <hi>Affecting of them.</hi> And there are three things, which the Spirit of God affects many men into, when He is making <hi>Essays</hi> towards the Converting of them.</p>
                    <p>First, There are dismal <hi>Terrours</hi> which the Spirit of God often causes in unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men. He terrifies them with hideous Visions of their own <hi>Wretchedness</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi>: and aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                            <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ightens them with a just Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if they continue as they are, <hi>He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will show them no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> We read in Rom. 8.15. about the <hi>Spirit of bondage unto fear.</hi> The Spirit of God makes many a man see himself <hi>bound</hi> over to endure the <hi>Fearful</hi> and Fiery Wrath of God for ever; He enkindles in them a <hi>Fear,</hi> that He is <hi>angry with them every day,</hi> and that He will <hi>break them sore in the place of Dragons at the Last Day.</hi> Thus the Spirit made <hi>Faelix</hi> to <hi>tremble,</hi> in the Fore-bodings of a <hi>Judgment to come.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secondly, There are serious <hi>Desires,</hi> which the Spirit of God often causes in unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men. He inflames warm desires in them after the <hi>Things of their Peace:</hi> and raises
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:000654_0150_0FA99EA6ADB0F9C8"/>
in them some Longings after <hi>Spiritual Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings in heavenly matters in Christ Jesus.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, that made the Jews cry out, Joh. 6.35.

                        <hi>Proposition,</hi> III.</head>
                    <p>Multitudes of wretched sinners <hi>Resist</hi> the <hi>Methods</hi> used by the Holy Spirit for the Conversion of their Souls; and in so doing they <hi>Resist the Holy Ghost.</hi> But how is this done? The Greek word here <hi>to Resist</hi> signifies <hi>To throw something in the way,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Passage</hi> or <hi>Journey</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. The Spirit of God is in the <hi>way</hi> of Converting many a man, but the mad sinner will throw, something or other in the <hi>way</hi> of the Holy Spirit, so that He makes a stop, a stand, He goes no further in it; This 'tis to <hi>Resist the Holy Ghost.</hi> Particularly;</p>
                    <p>First, Unconverted Sinners, <hi>Resist</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God by <hi>Diversion</hi>; when the Spirit of God would be <hi>Renewing</hi> of them, they throw some <hi>Diversion</hi> in his Way. Perhaps this Holy Spirit cannot come at them, because of their <hi>Business.</hi> When the Spirit would have been Recovering of wicked <hi>Cain</hi> from his forlorn estate, we find in Gen. 4.17. He went away to <hi>building of Cities.</hi> Men so get and keep in the clattering noise of the <hi>world</hi>
                        <pb n="149" facs="unknown:000654_0152_0FA99EA831ADC218"/>
they always find something to do, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a Thousand Hurries for themselves: Hence the Spirit of God never finds them at leisure enough, to do any thing upon them. Or, the Holy Spirit cannot come at them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their <hi>Company.</hi> 'Tis said of bad <hi>Companions,</hi> in Prov. 5.9, <hi>Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of Life,</hi> their <hi>ways are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable.</hi> Even so, least the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God should make men begin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                    <p>Secondly, Unconverted men <hi>Resist</hi> the Spirit of God by <hi>Denial.</hi> When the Spirit of God would be <hi>Renewing</hi> of them, they do throw a <hi>Positive Denial</hi> in his way, and so they send him away sorrowful. Their Impiety, is that in Job 21:14: <hi>They say to God depart from us, for we desire not the knowledg of thy ways.</hi> They say unto the Spirit of God <hi>Be gone, we desire not the happiness, which thou dost offer to us</hi>! They say unto him, <hi>Be gone, we desire not the Holiness, which thou dost a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="150" facs="unknown:000654_0153_0FA99EAA6E707550"/>
word thou hast spoken to us, we</hi> will <hi>not hearken to thee.</hi> Thus the Spirit of God saies, <hi>Pray in thy Family, Pray in thy Retirement</hi>: but lewd men say, <hi>No, we</hi> will <hi>not</hi>! The Spirt of God saies, <hi>Bind thy self by an Holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vnto the service of the Lord</hi>; but wild men say, <hi>No, we</hi> will <hi>not</hi>! The Spirit of God entreats, <hi>O do not the Abominable things which</hi> I <hi>hate!</hi> But there are extravagant men that say, <hi>We will do them every day!</hi> The Spirit of God now goes away grieved at this Cursed Obstinacy.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, Unconverted men <hi>Resist</hi> the Spirit of God by affronting, and abusing those in whom it is. Compare our Text with what follows, and you find things thus expressed. Mens <hi>Resisting of the Holy Ghost,</hi> is explained by their <hi>Persecuting</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>: truly, to <hi>Persecute</hi> the Ministers of the Gospel, who are <hi>Ministers of the Spirit</hi>; this is to <hi>Resist</hi> the Spirit Himself. To scoff, or starve, or slay those men, whom the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> hath made His <hi>Trumpets</hi> or His <hi>Temples,</hi> 'tis to <hi>Resist</hi> Him: So likewise to despise or oppose and suppress the Means of Grace, in which are the <hi>Demonstration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                    <p>This <hi>Resisting</hi> of the Holy Spirit, is that which confirms men in their impenitent unbelief. And this there is too doleful <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> for.</p>
                    <p>The Reason of it is, in short thus much; The <hi>Resisting</hi> of the Holy Spirit proves the <hi>withdrawing of that Spirit:</hi> He saies in Gen: 6:3. <hi>My Spirit shall not always strive</hi>; And if the Spirit shall cease to <hi>strive,</hi> the Sinner will never begin to <hi>turn.</hi> The Rule, the Old Rule, about the <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi> is too sadly verified in the motions of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> if you <hi>Resist him he will Flee from you.</hi> The <hi>Dove</hi> will not care to tarr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, where no good entertainment is ever like to be afforded Him. Indeed the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> gives no bar to his converting of them, who may be <hi>Resisting</hi> of Him; He <hi>can</hi> if he <hi>will</hi> proceed and conquer the most obdurate <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> in the World; He can cause the most obdurate <hi>Resistance</hi> to give way before Almighty Arm. But it is the <hi>Justice</hi> of the Holy Spirit that Countenances this order of things; when Men <hi>Resist</hi> the Spirit of God it is but <hi>just</hi> with him to <hi>desert</hi> them.

                    <p>First, The <hi>External</hi> Methods of the Holy Spirit for our Conversion will cease upon our long <hi>Resisting</hi> of Him.

this also, that his Providence will no more be concerned for us. Many a man, once had the <hi>Light of God shining upon his Tabernacle,</hi> but now every thing brings a Cross with it, and he may say, <hi>All things are against me.</hi> 'Tis because the Spirit of God speaking to him in his <hi>Prosperity</hi> hath been <hi>resisted</hi>; even for that cause now it is with him as in Ez: 7.26. <hi>Mischief shall come upon Mischief.</hi> On the other side, many a man had <hi>his way so hedged up with thorns,</hi> that he could not sin so easily, as else he would have done; but how God has done afflicting and restraining of him. Why? He <hi>Resisted</hi> the Spirit of God speaking to him in his <hi>Adversity</hi>; and now the Lord saies as in Hos. 7.14: <hi>He is joined to</hi> Idols, <hi>Let him alone</hi>: One of the Ancients upon that Scripture says, <hi>Vis Indignantis Dei terribilem vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem audire?</hi> Tis the terriblest Thunder of a Provoked and Revenging God!</p>
                    <p>Secondly, The <hi>Internal</hi> Methods of the Holy Spirit for our Conversion will also cease upon our long <hi>Resisting</hi> of Him.

                    <p>Yet more particularly,</p>
                    <p>First, A <hi>Resisting</hi> of the Holy Spirit, will provoke Him to leave us unto a <hi>Penal Blindness</hi> of Mind. It was the heavy ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God, upon some in <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.18. <hi>He hath shut their eyes, they cannot see.</hi> The Spirit of God may so leave us, upon <hi>Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> that no <hi>Heresy,</hi> no <hi>Blasphemy</hi> shall come amiss unto us, but we shall swallow down very damnable <hi>Delusions</hi> as the <hi>Oracles</hi> of God. Perhaps all the Monsters of <hi>Quakerism</hi> or of <hi>Popery,</hi> or any other Disguised <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> shall Recommend themselves unto us, as the most beautiful <hi>Mysteries of Godliness.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secondly, A <hi>Resisting</hi> of the Holy Spirit, will provoke Him to leave us unto a <hi>Paenal Hardness</hi> of Heart. As it was of old said in Exod. 10.27. <hi>The Lord hardened the Heart of Pharoah</hi>; Upon <hi>Resistance</hi> the Spirit of God will so leave us, that nothing shall <hi>melt us,</hi> nothing shall <hi>fright</hi> us, no calls, no crys, no counsels will cause us to turn from our <hi>Evil Ways</hi>; our hearts will be like the <hi>Nether

Milstone</hi> before the Lord; we shall now lay nothing to Heart, and there will be a <hi>seared Conscience</hi> in us: a Conscience that shall seldome, if ever sting us, for our sinful Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or Commissions, or for any of our <hi>Doings against the Lord.</hi> Once more,</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, A <hi>Resisting</hi> of the Holy Spirit, will so exasperate Him, That He will give us up to commit all manner of abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without <hi>Remorse.</hi> 'Twas said of some Rom. 1.26. <hi>God gave them up to vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi> Such an Horrendous Desolation, comes at last upon the Souls, that have long stood it out, against all the exhortations of the Eternal Spirit. That Spirit of God will so abandon us, that we shall be <hi>Devils</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, and yet never <hi>tremble</hi> as the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Devils</hi> do; we shall come to swear Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely, and violate Sabbaths, &amp; Curse, &amp; be Drunkards, and Wantons, and Cheat, and Ly, and be all that is <hi>Earthly, Sensual, Divel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,</hi> without any Horrour of Soul upon it; We shall make light of the most Roaring Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and being <hi>past feeling, work out all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaness with greediness</hi>; this tis for men to be confirmed in their impenitent unbelief.

Holy Spirit of God, that you may fear, a little <hi>Resistence</hi> more may cause the Eternal Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his influences from your Souls. Methinks I overhear the Holy Spirit of God saying to some of us, <hi>Be instructed, poor soul, be instructed quickly, lest I depart from thee, and thou become desolate for evermore.</hi> There are Souls whose <hi>Time</hi> is almost our, whose <hi>Glass</hi> is almost Run; the <hi>Inch of Candle</hi> is come just to the bottom with them; If they dont, presently, make a Good <hi>Bargain</hi> for Eternal Happiness, they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily perish in the <hi>dark.</hi> But, who are they?

                        <p>First, You that have bin long <hi>Incorrigible</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dispensations of the Holy Spirit, have cause to fear, that his <hi>Methods</hi> for your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are very near an end.

You have then cause to fear that he will quickly <hi>break up</hi> and <hi>be gone</hi>; That He will quickly say as in Isa. 1.5. <hi>Why should you be stricken any more</hi>? The Holy Spirit is the Physician of your Souls; perhaps He will try one or two <hi>Remedies</hi> more, for the Cure of your <hi>Distempers</hi>; but if they succeed not, tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he will then quickly Resolve, <hi>I will do no more for them, they will be filthy &amp; they shall be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, they will be wicked, and they shall be wicked; I
