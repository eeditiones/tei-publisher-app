            <head>Preface</head>
            <p>This document is the formal specification for TEI simplePrint, an entry-level
                customization of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines, intended to be
                generally useful to a large variety of encoders attempting to cope with the
                standardized representation of a variety of documents in digital form.</p>
            <p>Like every other TEI customization, TEI simplePrint was designed for use with a
                particular type of material. If the material you are planning to encode matches the
                following criteria, then TEI simplePrint is for you. If it does not, it may not be. <list>
                <item>You are encoding print material, rather than manuscript: simplePrint provides
                    no way of encoding manuscript features such as correction, deletion, or scribal
                    variation</item>
                <item>You are encoding material from the Early Modern period (i.e., up to the end of
                    the nineteenth century): some of the features for which simplePrint provides
                    encodings are rarely found in modern materials.</item>
                <item>You are encoding material written, broadly speaking, within the Western
                    European tradition, using largely Western European characters. simplePrint does
                    provide facilities for encoding short passages in non Western European
                    languages, but many features needed to cope with Asian or ancient scripts are
                    missing. </item>
                <item>Your intention is to provide a relatively simple encoding for a large amount
                    of material, rather than a rich encoding of a small amount of material:
                    simplePrint is intended to help libraries and archives wishing to go beyond
                    basic digital facsimiles, rather than to support specialist research. It does
                    not, for example, include features for detailed linguistic tagging beyond simple
                    word-level tagging, nor for specialised text types such as dictionaries,
                    historical or biographical databases, etc. </item>
                </list> If your needs go beyond those summarized here, simplePrint may still be a
                good point of departure, and may be very useful as a basis for the creation of your
                own TEI customisation. We don't however discuss the creation of a TEI customization
                in this document: the TEI website provides a number of links to tutorial material
                and tools which may assist in this process. </p>
            <p>The present document is intended to be generally comprehensible and accessible, but
                does assume some knowledge of XML (the encoding language used by the TEI), and of
                the way it is used by the TEI. Further information on both these topics are
                available from many places, not least the TEI's own web site at <ptr
                target="http://www.tei-c.org"/>.</p>
            <p>The TEI simplePrint schema was first elaborated as a part of the TEI Simple project
                funded by the <ref target="https://mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</ref>
                (2012-2014). The project sought to define a new <soCalled>highly-constrained and
                prescriptive subset</soCalled> of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines
                suited to the representation of early modern print materials, a formally-defined set
                of processing rules which permit modern web applications to easily present and
                analyze the encoded texts, mapping to other ontologies, and processes to describe
                the encoding status and richness of a TEI digital text. Its choice of elements
                reflected the practices followed in the encoding of large-scale literary archives,
                notably those produced by the Text Creation Partnership. Practice of other
                comparable archives such as the German Text Archive was also taken into account.</p>
            <p>The most distinctive feature of TEI simplePrint is its use of the TEI Processing
                Model, which provides explicit and recommended options for the display or processing
                of every textual element. Programmers developing systems to handle texts encoded
                with TEI simplePrint do not have to look beyond this when building stylesheets or
                other components. This greatly reduces the complexity of developing applications
                that will work reliably and consistently for many users and across large corpora of
                documents.</p>
            <p>The TEI simplePrint schema and the TEI Processing Model were first defined by a
                working group led by Martin Mueller (Northwestern University) and Sebastian Rahtz
                (Oxford University). Major contributions to the project were made by Magdalena
                Turska (Oxford University), James Cummings (Oxford University), and Brian Pytlik
                Zillig. The changes to the TEI scheme needed to support the TEI Processing Model
                were reviewed and approved by the TEI Technical Council for inclusion in release
                3.0.0 of TEI P5 in February 2016. The present document was extensively revised and
                extended by Lou Burnard in July 2016 for submission to the TEI Technical Council.

                <head>A Short Example</head>
                <p>We begin with a short example. How should we go about transferring into a
                    computer a passage of prose, such as the start of the last chapter of Charlotte
                    Brontë's novel <title>Jane Eyre</title>? We might start by simply copying what
                    we see on the printed page, typing it in such a way that what appears on the
                    screen looks as similar as possible, for example, by retaining the original line
                    breaks, by introducing blanks to represent the layout of the original headings,
                    page breaks, and paragraphs, and so forth. Of course, the possibilities are
                    limited by the nature of the computer program we use to capture the text: it may
                    not be possible for example to reflect accurately the typographic
                    characteristics of our source with all such software. Some characters in the
                    printed text (such as the accented letter <mentioned>a</mentioned> in
                    <mentioned>faàl</mentioned> or the long dash) may not be available on the
                    keyboard; some typographic distinctions (such as that between small capitals and
                    full capitals) may not be readily accessible. Our first attempt tries to mimic
                    the appearance of the former, and simply ignores the latter.</p>

                                CHAPTER 38

READER, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the par-
son and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I
went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking
the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, and I said --
  'Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.' The
housekeeper and her husband were of that decent, phlegmatic
order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a
remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having
one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation and subsequently stunned
by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did
stare at me; the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens
roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air,
and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the
polishing process; but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only --
   'Have you, miss? Well, for sure!'
   A short time after she pursued, 'I seed you go out with the master,
but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed'; and she
basted away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to
ear.
   'I telled Mary how it would be,' he said: 'I knew what Mr Ed-
ward' (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he
was the cadet of the house, therefore he often gave him his Christian
name) -- 'I knew what Mr Edward would do; and I was certain he
would not wait long either: and he's done right, for aught I know. I
wish you joy, miss!' and he politely pulled his forelock.
   'Thank you, John. Mr Rochester told me to give you and Mary
this.'
   I put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear
more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time
after, I caught the words --
   'She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.' And
again, 'If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faa\l, and varry
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see
that.'
   I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what
I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and

                            474

                 JANE EYRE                      475

Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she
would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she
would come and see me.
   'She had better not wait till then, Jane,' said Mr Rochester, when I
read her letter to him; 'if she does, she will be too late, for our honey-
moon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
grave or mine.'
   How St John received the news I don't know: he never answered
the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote
to me, without, however, mentioning Mr Rochester's name or allud-
ing to my marriage. His letter was then calm, and though very serious,
kind. He has maintained a regular, though not very frequent correspond-
ence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who
live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.

      </eg> </p>
                <p>This transcription suffers from a number of shortcomings: <list>
                    <item>the page numbers and running titles are intermingled with the text in a
                        way which makes it difficult for software to distinguish them;</item>
                    <item>no distinction is made between single quotation marks and apostrophe, so
                        it is difficult to be certain exactly which passages are in direct
                        speech;</item>
                    <item>the preservation of the copy text's hyphenation means that simple-minded
                        search programs will not find words broken across a line;</item>
                    <item>the accented letter in <mentioned>faàl</mentioned> and the long dash have
                        been rendered by ad hoc keying conventions (<mentioned>faa\l</mentioned>)
                        which follow no standard pattern and will be processed correctly only if the
                        transcriber remembers to mention them in the documentation;</item>
                    <item>paragraph divisions are marked only by the use of white space, and hard
                        carriage returns have been introduced at the end of each line. Consequently,
                        if the size of type used to display the text changes, reformatting will be
                        problematic.</item>
                    </list> </p>
                <p>We now present the same passage, as it might be encoded in TEI simplePrint. As we
                    shall see, there are many ways in which this encoding could be extended, but as
                    a minimum, the TEI approach allows us to represent the following distinctions in
                    a standardized way: <list>
                    <item>Paragraph and chapter divisions are now marked explicitly by means of tags
                        rather than implicitly by white space.</item>
                    <item>Apostrophes are retained, but the quotation marks indicating direct speech
                        have been removed, and direct speech is now marked explicitly by means of a
                        tag. </item>
                    <item>The accented letter and the long dash are accurately represented, using
                        the appropriate Unicode character.</item>

                    <p>Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
                        clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I went into the
                        kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner, and John
                        cleaning the knives, and I said —</p>
                    <p> <q>Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.</q> The
                        housekeeper and her husband were of that decent, phlegmatic order of people,
                        to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece of news
                        without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some shrill
                        ejaculation and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary
                        did look up, and she did stare at me; the ladle with which she was basting a
                        pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang
                        suspended in air, and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest
                        from the polishing process; but Mary, bending again over the roast, said
                        only —</p>
                    <p> <q>Have you, miss? Well, for sure!</q> </p>
                    <p>A short time after she pursued, <q>I seed you go out with the master, but I
                        didn't know you were gone to church to be wed</q>; and she basted away.
                        John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear. <q>I telled Mary
                        how it would be,</q> he said: <q>I knew what Mr Edward</q> (John was an old
                        servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the house,
                        therefore he often gave him his Christian name) — <q>I knew what Mr Edward
                        would do; and I was certain he would not wait long either: and he's done
                        right, for aught I know. I wish you joy, miss!</q> and he politely pulled
                        his forelock.</p>
                    <p> <q>Thank you, John. Mr Rochester told me to give you and Mary this.</q> </p>
                    <p>I put into his hand a five-pound note. Without waiting to hear more, I left
                        the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I caught
                        the words —</p>
                    <p> <q>She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.</q> And
                        again, <q>If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faàl, and varry
                        good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that.</q> </p>
                    <p>I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done:
                        fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and <pb n="475"/> Mary
                        approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she would just give me
                        time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.</p>
                    <p> <q>She had better not wait till then, Jane,</q> said Mr Rochester, when I
                        read her letter to him; <q>if she does, she will be too late, for our
                        honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your grave
                        or mine.</q> </p>
                    <p>How St John received the news I don't know: he never answered the letter in
                        which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me, without,
                        however, mentioning Mr Rochester's name or alluding to my marriage. His
                        letter was then calm, and though very serious, kind. He has maintained a
                        regular, though not very frequent correspondence ever since: he hopes I am
                        happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in the world, and
                        only mind earthly things.</p>
                    </div> </egXML> </p>
                <p>This encoding is expressed in TEI XML, a very widely used and standardized method
                    of representing information about a document within the document itself. The
                    transcribed words are complemented by special flags within angle brackets,
                    called <term>tags</term>, which both characterise and mark the beginning and end
                    of a string of characters. For example, each paragraph is marked by a tag
                    <tag>p</tag> at its start, and a corresponding <tag>/p</tag> at its end. We
                    don't elaborate further on the syntax of TEI XML here. <note place="foot">Many
                    introductory tutorials on XML are available on the web, for example at <ptr
                    target="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/"/>. The way the TEI uses XML is fully
                    documented in <ref
                    target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html">section v
                    of the TEI Guidelines</ref>; a very basic introduction to TEI XML is also
                    available at <ptr target="http://www.ultraslavonic.info/intro-to-xml"/>. The
                    formal specification of the XML language is at <ptr
                    target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml"/>.</note> </p>
                <p>Aside from its syntax, it is important to note that this particular encoding
                    represents a set of choices or priorities. We have chosen to prioritize and
                    simplify the representation of the words of the text over the representation of
                    the typographic layout associated with them in this source document. This makes
                    it easier for a computer to answer questions about the words in the document
                    than about its typesetting, reflecting our research priorities. This priority
                    also leads us to suppress end-of-line hyphenation. Conceivably Brontë (or her
                    printer) intended the word <q>honeymoon</q> to appear as <q>honey-moon</q> on
                    its second appearance, though this seems unlikely: our decision to focus on
                    Brontë's text, rather than on the printing of it in this particular edition,
                    makes it impossible to be certain. Similarly, our decision makes it impossible
                    to use this transcription as a means of statistically analysing hyphenation
                    practice. An encoding makes explicit all and only those textual features of
                    importance to the encoder.</p>
                <p>It is not difficult to think of ways in which the encoding of even this short
                    passage might readily be extended to address other research priorities. For
                    example: <list type="simple">
                    <item>a regularized form of the passages in dialect could be provided; </item>
                    <item>footnotes glossing or commenting on any passage could be added;</item>
                    <item>pointers linking parts of this text to others could be added;</item>
                    <item>proper names of various kinds could be distinguished from the surrounding

                    <item>names could be classified as personal, geographical, or
                        institutional</item>
                    <item>detailed bibliographic information about the text's provenance and context
                        could be prefixed to it;</item>
                    <item>a linguistic analysis of the passage into sentences, clauses, words, etc.,
                        could be provided, each unit being associated with appropriate category
                        codes;</item>
                    <item>the text could be segmented into narrative or discourse units;</item>
                    <item>systematic analysis or interpretation of the text could be included in the
                        encoding, with potentially complex alignment or linkage between the text and
                        the analysis, or between the text and one or more translations of it;</item>
                    <item>passages in the text could be linked to images or sound held on other
                        media.</item>
                    </list> </p>
                <p>In the remainder of this document, we present a number of TEI-recommended ways of
                    supporting these and other encoding requirements. These ways generally involve
                    the application of specific TEI XML elements, selected from the full range of
                    possibilities documented in the TEI <title>Guidelines</title>. Like every other
                    TEI project, TEI Simple proposes a view of the TEI Guidelines. This document
                    defines and documents that view. </p>

                <head>The Structure of a TEI simplePrint Document</head>
                <p>A TEI-conformant text contains (a) a <term>TEI header</term> (marked up as a
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> element) and (b) one or more representations of a text. These
                    representations may be of three kinds: a transcribed text, marked up as a
                    <gi>text</gi> element; a collection of digital images representing the text,
                    marked up using a <gi>facsimile</gi> element; or a literal transcription of one
                    or more documents instantiating the text, marked up using the <gi>sourceDoc</gi>
                    element.</p>
                <p>These elements are combined together to form a single <gi>TEI</gi> element, which
                    must be declared within the TEI <term>namespace</term>, and therefore usually
                    takes the form <tag>TEI xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"</tag> <note
                    place="foot">A <term>namespace</term> is an XML concept. Its function is to
                    identify the vocabulary from which a group of element names are drawn, using a
                    standard identifier resembling a web address. The namespace for TEI elements is
                    <val>http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0</val> </note>.</p>
                <p>Some aspects of the TEI header are described in more detail in section <ptr
                    target="#Simple-header"/>. In what follows, we will focus chiefly on the use of
                    the <gi>text</gi> element, though we describe one way of using the
                    <gi>facsimile</gi> element in combination with it or alone in section <ptr
                    target="#Simple-fax"/>. We do not consider the <gi>sourceDoc</gi> element
                    further, since it is mainly used in very specialised applications for which TEI
                    simplePrint would not be appropriate. </p>
                <p>A text may be <term>unitary</term> (a single work) or <term>composite</term> (a
                    collection of single works, such as an anthology). In either case, the text may
                    have optional <term>front</term> or <term>back</term> matter such as title
                    pages, prefaces, appendixes etc. We use the term <term>body</term> for whatever
                    comes between these in the source document. We discuss various kinds of
                    composite text in section <ptr target="#Simple-composite"/> below.</p>
                <p>A unitary text will be encoded using an overall structure like this: <egXML
                    valid="feasible" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <TEI>
                    <teiHeader><!-- [ TEI Header information ]  --></teiHeader> <text>

                    <body>
                        <!-- [ body of text ... ]  --> </body>
                    <back><!--  [ back matter ...  ] --> </back>
                    </text> </TEI> </egXML> </p>
                <p>In each of the following sections we include a short list of the TEI
                    <term>elements</term> under discussion, along with a brief description, and in
                    most cases an example of how they are used. Throughout the text, element names
                    are linked to their detailed reference documentation, as given in the TEI
                    Guidelines. Note that most of the examples provided by the reference
                    documentation, and all of the links, are not specific to TEI simplePrint. </p>
                <p>For example, here are the elements discussed so far: <specList>

            <div xml:id="Simple-body">
                <head>Encoding the Body</head>
                <p>As indicated above, a unitary text is encoded by means of a <gi>text</gi>
                    element, which may contain the following elements: <specList>
                    <specDesc key="front"/>

                    <specDesc key="back"/>
                    </specList> Elements specific to front and back matter are described below in
                    section <ptr target="#Simple-fronbac"/>. In this section we discuss the elements
                    making up the body of a text. A text must always have a body.</p>
                <div xml:id="divs">
                    <head>Text Division Elements and Global Attributes</head>
                    <p>The body of a prose text may be just a series of paragraphs or similar blocks
                        of text, or these may be grouped together into chapters, sections,
                        subsections, etc. The <gi>div</gi> element is used to represent any such
                        grouping of blocks. <specList>
                        <specDesc atts="type" key="div"/>
                        </specList> </p>
                    <p>The <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>div</gi> element may be used to
                        supply a conventional name for this category of text division in order to
                        distinguish them. Typical values might be <val>book</val>,
                        <val>chapter</val>, <val>section</val>, <val>part</val>, <val>poem</val>,
                        <val>song</val>, etc. TEI simplePrint does not constrain the range of values
                        that may be used here. </p>
                    <p>A <gi>div</gi> element may itself contain further, nested, <gi>div</gi>s,
                        thus mimicking the traditional structure of a book, which can be decomposed
                        hierarchically into units such as parts, containing chapters, containing
                        sections, and so on. TEI texts in general conform to this simple hierarchic
                        model.</p>
                    <p>Here as elsewhere the <att>xml:id</att> attribute may be used to supply a
                        unique identifier for the division, which may be used for cross references
                        or other links to it, such as a commentary, as further discussed in section
                        <ptr target="#Simple-ptrs"/>. It is good practice to provide an
                        <att>xml:id</att> attribute for every major structural unit in a text, and
                        to derive its values in some systematic way, for example by appending a
                        section number to a short code for the title of the work in question, as in
                        the examples below. </p>
                    <p>The <att>n</att> attribute may be used to supply (additionally or
                        alternatively) a short mnemonic name or number for a division, or any other
                        element. If a conventional form of reference or abbreviation for the parts
                        of a work already exists (such as the book/chapter/verse pattern of Biblical
                        citations), the <att>n</att> attribute is the place to record it; unlike the
                        identifier supplied by the <att>xml:id</att> attribute, it does not need to
                        be unique.</p>
                    <p>The <att>xml:lang</att> attribute may be used to specify the language of the
                        division. Languages are identified by an internationally defined code, as
                        further discussed in section <ptr target="#z636"/> below.</p>
                    <p>The <att>rendition</att> attribute may be used to supply information about
                        the rendition (appearance) of a division, or any other element, as further
                        discussed in section <ptr target="#Simple-hilites"/> below. Note that this
                        attribute is used to describe the appearance of the <emph>source</emph>
                        text, rather than the appearance of any intended output when the encoded
                        text is displayed. The two may of course be similar, or identical, but the
                        TEI does not assume or require this.</p>
                    <p>These four attributes, <att>xml:id</att>, <att>n</att>, <att>xml:lang</att>,
                        and <att>rendition</att> are so widely useful that they are allowed on any
                        element in any TEI schema: they are called <term>global attributes</term>.
                        Other attributes defined in the TEI simplePrint schema are discussed in
                        section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p>
                    <p>As noted above, the value of every <att>xml:id</att> attribute must be unique
                        within a document. One simple way of ensuring this is to make it reflect the
                        hierarchic structure of the document. For example, Smith's <title>Wealth of
                        Nations</title> as first published consists of five books, each of which is
                        divided into chapters, while some chapters are further subdivided into
                        parts. We might define <att>xml:id</att> values for this structure as
                        follows: <egXML valid="feasible" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <body>
                        <div n="I" type="book" xml:id="WN1">
                            <div n="I.1" type="chapter" xml:id="WN101">
                                <!-- ... --> </div>
                            <div n="I.2" type="chapter" xml:id="WN102">
                                <!-- ... --> </div>
                            <!-- ... -->
                            <div n="I.10" type="chapter" xml:id="WN110">
                                <div n="I.10.1" type="part" xml:id="WN1101">
                                    <!-- ... --> </div>
                                <div n="I.10.2" type="part" xml:id="WN1102">
                                    <!-- ... --> </div>
                            </div>
                            <!-- ... -->
                        </div>
                        <div n="II" type="book" xml:id="WN2">
                            <!-- ... --> </div>
                        </body> </egXML> </p>
                    <p>A different numbering scheme may be used for <att>xml:id</att> and
                        <att>n</att> attributes: this is often useful where a canonical reference
                        scheme is used which does not tally with the structure of the work. For
                        example, in a novel divided into books each containing chapters, where the
                        chapters are numbered sequentially through the whole work, rather than
                        within each book, one might use a scheme such as the following: <egXML
                        valid="feasible" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <body>
                        <div n="1" type="volume" xml:id="TS01">
                            <div n="1" type="chapter" xml:id="TS011">
                                <!-- ... --> </div>
                            <div n="2" type="chapter" xml:id="TS012">
                                <!-- ... --> </div>
                        </div>
                        <div n="2" type="volume" xml:id="TS02">
                            <div n="3" type="chapter" xml:id="TS021">
                                <!-- ... --> </div>
                            <div n="4" type="chapter" xml:id="TS022">
                                <!-- ... --> </div>
                        </div>
                        </body> </egXML> Here the work has two volumes, each containing two
                        chapters. The chapters are numbered conventionally 1 to 4, but the
                        <att>xml:id</att> values specified allow them to be regarded additionally as
                        if they were numbered 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2.</p>
                </div>
                <div xml:id="h25">
                    <head>Headings and Closings</head>
                    <p>Every <gi>div</gi> may have a title or heading at its start, and (less
                        commonly) a trailer such as <q>End of Chapter 1</q> at its end. The
                        following elements may be used to transcribe them: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="head"/>
                        <specDesc key="trailer"/>
                        </specList> Some other elements which may be found at the beginning or
                        ending of text divisions are discussed below in section <ptr target="#h52"
                        />.</p>
                    <p>Whether or not headings and trailers are included in a transcription is a
                        matter for the individual transcriber to decide. Where a heading is
                        completely regular (for example <q>Chapter 1</q>) or may be automatically
                        constructed from attribute values (e.g. <tag>div type="chapter"
                        n="1"</tag>), it may be omitted; where it contains otherwise unrecoverable
                        text it should always be included. For example, the start of Hardy's
                        <title>Under the Greenwood Tree</title> might be encoded as follows: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <div n="Winter" type="part"

                    <head>Textual Components</head>
                    <p>In prose texts such as the Brontë example above, the divisions are generally
                        composed of paragraphs, represented as <gi>p</gi> elements, though in some
                        circumstances it may be preferred to use the <soCalled>anonymous
                        block</soCalled> element <gi>ab</gi>. In poetic or dramatic texts different
                        elements are used, representing stanzas and verse lines in the first case,
                        and individual speeches or stage directions in the second: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="p"/>
                        <specDesc key="ab"/>

                        <specDesc key="stage"/>
                        </specList> </p>
                    <p>We discuss each of these kinds of component separately below.</p>
                    <div>
                        <head>Verse</head>
                        <p>Here, for example, is the start of a poetic text in which verse lines and
                            stanzas are tagged: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <lg
                            n="I"> <l>I Sing the progresse of a deathlesse soule,</l> <l>Whom Fate,

                        <p>Note that the <gi>l</gi> element marks verse lines, not typographic
                            lines: as elsewhere the original lineation of the source text is not
                            therefore preserved by this encoding. The <gi>lb</gi> element described
                            in section <ptr target="#Simple-pln"/> might additionally be used to
                            mark typographic lines if so desired. </p>
                        <p>In a poetic text it may also be considered useful to identify the rhymes,
                            for which the following element may be used: <specList>
                            <specDesc atts="label" key="rhyme"/>
                            </specList> The following example shows how this element might be used
                            both to identify rhyming words or word parts and to assign each rhyme to
                            a part of a rhyming pattern by means of its <att>label</att> attribute.
                            The rhyming pattern here is specified by the <att>rhyme</att> attribute
                            supplied on the <gi>lg</gi> representing the stanza within which the
                            pattern operates: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <lg
                            rhyme="AABCCBBA"> <l>The sunlight on the <rhyme label="A">garden</rhyme>

                            The <att>rhyme</att> attribute may be used independently of the
                            <gi>rhyme</gi> element, or in combination with it, as above. </p>

                    <div>
                        <head>Drama</head>
                        <p>A dramatic text contains speeches, which may be in prose or verse, and
                            will also contain stage directions. The <gi>sp</gi> element is used to
                            represent each identified speech. It contains an optional speaker
                            indication, marked with the <gi>speaker</gi> element, which can be
                            followed by one or more <gi>l</gi> or <gi>p</gi> elements, depending on
                            whether the speech is considered to be in prose or in verse. Stage
                            directions, whether within or between speeches, are marked using the
                            <gi>stage</gi> element. </p>
                        <p>For example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <sp>
                            <speaker>Vladimir</speaker> <p>Pull on your trousers.</p> </sp> <sp>

                        <p>In a verse drama, it is quite common to find that verse lines are split
                            between speakers. The easiest way of encoding this is to use the
                            <att>part</att> attribute to indicate that the lines so fragmented are
                            incomplete: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <div n="I"

                            just that the element bearing is fragmented in some (unspecified)

                            preference to the <gi>p</gi> element. It should be used for blocks of
                            text which are not clearly paragraphs, verse lines, or dramatic
                            speeches. Typical examples include the canonical verses of the Bible,
                            and the textual blocks of other ancient documents which predate the
                            invention of the paragraph, such as Greek inscriptions or Egyptian
                            hieroglyphs. The element is also useful as a means of encoding more
                            specialized kinds of textual block, such as the question and answer
                            structure of a catechism, or the highly formalized substructure of a

                            these). In more modern documents, it can be used to encode

                            work in progress; or to faithfully capture the substructure of a file

                        <specDesc key="fw"/>
                        </specList> The <gi>pb</gi>, <gi>lb</gi>, and <gi>cb</gi> elements are
                        special cases of a general class of elements known as
                        <term>milestone</term>s because they mark reference points within a text.
                        The generic <gi>milestone</gi> element can mark any kind of reference point:
                        for example, a column break, the start of a new kind of section not
                        otherwise tagged, a change of author or style, or in general any significant
                        change in the text not enclosed by an XML element. Unlike other elements,
                        milestone elements do not enclose a piece of text and make an assertion
                        about it; instead they indicate a point in the text where something changes,
                        as indicated by a change in the values of the milestone's attributes
                        <att>unit</att>, which indicates the <q>something</q> concerned, and
                        <att>n</att> which indicates the new value. </p>
                    <p>The <gi>pb</gi>, <gi>lb</gi>, and <gi>cb</gi> elements are shortcuts or
                        <term>syntactic sugar</term> for <tag>milestone unit="page"/</tag>
                        <tag>milestone unit="line"/</tag> and <tag>milestone unit="column"/</tag>
                        respectively. </p>
                    <p>When working from a paginated original, it is often useful to record its
                        pagination, whether to simplify later proof-reading, or to align the
                        transcribed text with a set of page images, as further discussed below.</p>
                    <p>Because <gi>pb</gi> and other milestone elements are empty, they may be
                        placed freely within or between other elements. However, it is recommended
                        practice always to put them at the <emph>beginning</emph> of whatever unit
                        it is that their presence implies, and not to nest them within elements
                        contained by that unit. For example, in the following example a page break
                        occurs between two lines of a poem: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <l>Mary had a little lamb</l> <pb
                        n="13"/> <l>Its fleece was white as snow</l> </egXML> The <gi>pb</gi>
                        element should be placed ahead of all the text encoded on the 13th page.
                        Contrast this with the following less accurate encoding: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <l>Mary had a little lamb</l> <l>
                        <pb n="13"/>Its fleece was white as snow</l> </egXML> This is less accurate
                        because it implies that the second verse line actually begins before the
                        page break. </p>
                    <p>Similar considerations apply to line breaks (<gi>lb</gi>), though these are
                        less frequently considered useful when encoding modern printed textual
                        sources. When transcribing manuscripts or early printed books, however, it
                        is often helpful to retain them in an encoding, if only to facilitate
                        alignment of transcription and original. Like <gi>pb</gi>, the <gi>lb</gi>
                        element should appear <emph>before</emph> the text of the line whose start
                        it signals.</p>
                    <p>If features such as pagination or lineation are marked for more than one
                        edition, the edition in question may be specified by the <att>ed</att>
                        attribute. For example, in the following passage we indicate where the page
                        breaks occur in two different editions (<val>ED1</val> and <val>ED2</val>):
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <p>I wrote to Moor House
                        and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done: fully explaining also
                        why I had thus acted. Diana and <pb ed="ED1" n="475"/> Mary approved the
                        step unreservedly. Diana announced that she would <pb ed="ED2" n="485"/>just
                        give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see
                        me.</p> </egXML> </p>
                    <p>When transcribing from a paginated source, the encoder must decide whether to
                        suppress such features as running titles, page signatures, catch words etc.,
                        to replace them by a simplified representation using the <gi>pb</gi>
                        element, perhaps using the <att>n</att> attribute to preserve some of the
                        information, or to preserve them entirely using the <gi>fw</gi> element. The
                        latter strategy is appropriate in encodings which aim to retain as much
                        information as possible about the original typography; it will however make
                        more complex the processing of the source for other purposes, as in the
                        following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <l>He
                        also fix'd the wandering QUEEN OF NIGHT,</l> <fw type="sig">Ii 2</fw> <fw
                        type="catch">Whether</fw> <pb n="244"/> <l>Whether she wanes into a scanty
                        orb</l>...<!-- Thomson, Seasons, 1730--> </egXML> </p>
                    <p>The <gi>pb</gi> element is also used to align parts of a transcription with a
                        digital image of the page concerned. This may be done in a very simple but
                        inflexible way by using the <att>facs</att> attribute to point to each page
                        image concerned: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <p>I wrote
                        to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done: fully
                        explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and <pb ed="ED1"
                        facs="ed1p475.png" n="475"/> Mary approved the step unreservedly... </p>
                        </egXML> The <att>facs</att> attribute can supply (as here) a filename, or
                        any other form of URI, if for example the page image is stored remotely. One
                        drawback of this simplistic approach is that there must be exactly one image
                        file per page of text. It is not therefore suitable in the case where the
                        available page images represent double page spreads, or where there are
                        multiple images of the same page (for example at different resolutions). </p>
                    <p>A more powerful approach, discussed in section <ptr target="#Simple-fax"/>
                        below, is to use the <gi>facsimile</gi> element to define the organisation
                        of the set of images representing the text, and then use the <att>facs</att>
                        attribute to point to individual components of that representation. </p>

                        <p>The global <att>rendition</att> attribute can be attached to any element,

                            for it in the source. For example, a heading rendered in bold might be
                            tagged <tag>head rendition="simple:bold"</tag>, and one in italic
                            <tag>head rendition="simple:italic"</tag>.</p>
                        <p>The values used for the <att>rendition</att> attribute point to

                            may be used to mark a sequence of highlighted text without making any

                            should be used. Again, the global <att>rendition</att> attribute can be
                            used to record details of the highlighting used in the source if this is
                            thought useful. </p>
                        <p>As an example of the elements defined here, consider the following
                            sentence: <q rendition="simple:display">On the one hand the <hi
                            rendition="simple:italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> is associated with the new
                            rise of romance of twelfth-century France, the <hi
                            rendition="simple:italic">romans d'antiquité</hi>, the romances of
                            Chrétien de Troyes, and the German adaptations of these works by
                            Heinrich van Veldeke, Hartmann von Aue, and Wolfram von Eschenbach.</q>
                            Interpreting the role of the highlighting, the sentence might be encoded
                            as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <p>On the
                            one hand the <title>Nibelungenlied</title> is associated with the new

                            </egXML> Describing only the appearance of the original, it might be
                            encoded like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                        <head>Quotations and Related Features</head>
                        <p>Like changes of typeface, quotation marks are conventionally used to
                            denote several different features within a text, of which the most
                            frequent is quotation, though many other features are possible. The full
                            TEI Guidelines provide additional elements such as <gi>mentioned</gi> or
                            <gi>said</gi> to distinguish some of these features, but these more
                            specialised elements are not included in TEI simplePrint. In TEI Simple
                            however, we use the <gi>quote</gi> element for quotation only, and the
                            <gi>q</gi> element for all other material found within quotation marks
                            in the text.<specList>
                            <specDesc key="q"/>
                            <specDesc key="quote"/>
                            <!--specDesc key="said"/-->
                            <!--specDesc key="mentioned"/>-->

                            </specList> </p>
                        <p>Here is a simple example of a quotation: <egXML
                            xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <p>Few dictionary makers are
                            likely to forget Dr. Johnson's description of the lexicographer as
                            <quote>a harmless drudge.</quote> </p> </egXML> </p>
                        <p>As elsewhere, the way that a citation or quotation was printed (for
                            example, <term>in-line</term> or set off as a <hi>display</hi> or
                            <hi>block quotation</hi>), may be represented using the
                            <att>rendition</att> attribute. This may also be used to indicate the
                            kind of quotation marks used.</p>
                        <p>Direct speech interrupted by a narrator can be represented simply by
                            ending the <gi>q</gi> element and beginning it again after the
                            interruption, as in the following example: <egXML
                            xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <p> <q>Who-e debel you?</q> —
                            he at last said — <q>you no speak-e, damme, I kill-e.</q> And so saying,
                            the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.</p>
                            </egXML> If it is important to convey the idea that the two <gi>q</gi>
                            elements together make up a single speech, the linking attributes
                            <att>next</att> and <att>prev</att> may be used, as described in section
                            <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p>
                        <p>Direct speech may be accompanied by a reference to the source or speaker,
                            using the <att>who</att> attribute, whether or not this is explicit in
                            the text, as in the following example: <egXML
                            xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <q who="#Wilson">Spaulding, he
                            came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper
                            in his hand, and he says:—<q who="#Spaulding">I wish to the Lord, Mr.
                            Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.</q> </q> </egXML> This example also
                            demonstrates how quotations may be embedded within other quotations: one
                            speaker (Wilson) quotes another speaker (Spaulding).</p>
                        <p>The creator of the electronic text must decide whether quotation marks
                            are replaced by the tags or whether the tags are added and the quotation
                            marks kept. If the quotation marks are removed from the text, the
                            <att>rendition</att> attribute may be used to record the way in which
                            they were rendered in the copy text.</p>
                        <!-- example please -->
                    </div>
                    <div xml:id="z636">

                        <p>Words, phrases, or longer stretches of text that are not in the main
                            language of the texts may be tagged as such in one of two ways. The
                            global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute may be attached to any element to
                            show that it uses some other language than that of the surrounding text.
                            Where there is no applicable element, the element <gi>foreign</gi> may
                            be used, again using the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute. For example:
                            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <p>John has real
                            <foreign xml:lang="fr">savoir-faire</foreign>.</p> <p>Have you read
                            <title xml:lang="de">Die Dreigroschenoper</title>?</p> </egXML> </p>
                        <p>As these examples show, the <gi>foreign</gi> element should not be used
                            to tag foreign words if some other more specific element such as
                            <gi>title</gi>, or <gi>div</gi> applies. </p>
                        <p>The value of the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute on an element applies
                            hierarchically to everything contained by that element, unless
                            overridden:</p>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <div xml:lang="la">

                        <p>Here we specify that the whole <gi>div</gi> element uses the language
                            with the coded identifier <val>la</val> i.e., Latin. Since it is
                            contained by that <gi>div</gi> there is no need to supply this
                            information again for the first <gi>s</gi> element. The second
                            <gi>s</gi> element however overrides this value, and indicates that its
                            content is in English (the language with identifier <val>en</val>). The
                            third <gi>s</gi> element is again in Latin.</p>

                    <p>A note is any additional comment found in a text, marked in some way as being
                        out of the main textual stream. A note is always attached to some part of
                        the text, implicitly or explicitly: we call this its target, or its
                        <term>point of attachment</term>. The element <gi>note</gi> should be used
                        to mark any kind of note whether it appears as a separate block of text in
                        the main text area, at the foot of the page, at the end of the chapter or
                        volume, in the margin, or in some other place. <specList>
                        <specDesc key="note"/>
                        </specList> </p>
                    <p>Notes may be in a different hand or typeface, may be authorial or editorial,
                        and may have been added later. The attributes <att>type</att> and
                        <att>resp</att> can be used to distinguish between different kinds of notes
                        or identify their authors.</p>
                    <p>In a printed or written text, the point of attachment for a note is typically
                        represented by a siglum such as an alphanumerical or other character, often
                        in superscripted form. When encoding such a text, it is conventional to
                        replace this siglum by a note element containing the annotation itself, as
                        in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                        <p>...some text <note xml:id="n7">a note about some text</note> .... </p>
                        </egXML> </p>
                    <p>An alternative approach is to encode the point of attachment wherever it
                        appears in the text, using for example the <gi>ref</gi> element discussed in
                        the next section, and to place the <gi>note</gi> element anywhere
                        convenient. The two can then be associated by using the <att>target</att>
                        attribute on the <gi>ref</gi> element to point to the <gi>note</gi> element,
                        as in the following example, in which the superscripted <q>7</q> indicating
                        the point of attachment has been retained as part of the encoding: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <p>...some text <ref
                        rendition="simple:superscript" target="#n7">7</ref> .... <note xml:id="n7">a
                        note about some text</note> </p> </egXML> </p>
                    <p>It may however be problematic to determine the precise position of the point
                        of attachment, particularly in the case of marginal notes. A marginal note
                        may also be hard to distinguish from a label or subheading which introduces
                        the text with which it is associated. Where the purpose of the note is
                        clearly to label the associated text, rather than to comment on it, the
                        element <gi>label</gi> may be preferable. Where it is clearly a subheading
                        attached to a distinct subdivision, it may be preferable to start a new
                        element <gi>div</gi> and encode the subheading as a <gi>head</gi>. Note
                        however that a <gi>head</gi> cannot be inserted anywhere except at the
                        beginning of a <gi>div</gi>. And where (as in some Early Modern English
                        plays) marginal annotation is systematically used to identify speakers, it
                        may be better to represent these using the <gi>speaker</gi> element
                        introduced above. In cases of doubt, the encoder should decide on a clear
                        policy and preferably document it for the use of others. </p>

                    <head>Cross References and Links</head>
                    <p>Any kind of cross reference or link found at one point in a text which points
                        to another part of the same or another document may be encoded using the
                        <gi>ref</gi> element discussed in this section. Implicit links (such as the
                        association between two parallel texts, or that between a text and its
                        interpretation) may be encoded using the linking attributes discussed in
                        section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p>
                    <div xml:id="ptrs">
                        <head>Simple Cross References</head>
                        <p> <specList>
                            <specDesc key="ref"/>
                            </specList> </p>
                        <p>Usually, the presence of a cross-reference or link will be indicated by
                            some text or symbol in the source being encoded, which will then become
                            the content of the <gi>ref</gi> element. Occasionally, however, and
                            frequently in the case of a born digital document, the exact form and
                            appearance of the cross reference text will be determined dynamically by
                            the software processing the document. In such cases, the <gi>ref</gi>
                            element will have no content, and serve simply to mark a point from
                            which a link is to be made, along with the target of the link. </p>
                        <p>The following two forms, for example, are logically equivalent: <egXML
                            xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ref
                            target="#SEC12">section 12 on page 34</ref>.</egXML> <egXML
                            xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ref
                            target="#SEC12"/>.</egXML> In both cases, there is a cross reference
                            from the position in the source document immediately following the word
                            <mentioned>especially</mentioned> to whatever element in the encoded
                            document has the identifier <val>SEC12</val>. In the first case, the
                            encoder has supplied the original form of the cross reference
                            <soCalled>section 12 on page 34</soCalled>; in the second, the task of
                            generating an appropriate form of cross reference has been left to the
                            formatting software. Perhaps the pagination and section numbers of the
                            document in question are not yet determined; perhaps the cross reference
                            should be replaced by a big red button. In either case, however, the
                            value of the <att>target</att> attribute must be the identifier of some
                            other element within the current document. Since the passage or phrase
                            being pointed at must bear an identifier, it must be an element of some
                            kind. In the following example, the cross reference is to a <gi>div</gi>
                            element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... see
                            especially <ref target="#SEC12"/>. ... <div xml:id="SEC12">
                            <head>Concerning Identifiers</head>
                            <!-- ... -->
                            </div> </egXML> </p>
                        <p>Because the <att>xml:id</att> attribute is global, any element in a TEI
                            document may be pointed to in this way. In the following example, a
                            paragraph has been given an identifier so that it may be pointed at:
                            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... this is discussed
                            in <ref target="#pspec">the paragraph on links</ref> ... <p
                            xml:id="pspec">Links may be made to any kind of element ...</p> </egXML> </p>
                        <p>Sometimes the target of a cross reference does not correspond with any
                            particular feature of a text, and so may not be tagged as an element of
                            some kind. If the desired target is simply a point in the current
                            document, the easiest way to mark it is by introducing an
                            <gi>anchor</gi> element at the appropriate spot. If the target is some
                            sequence of words not otherwise tagged, the <gi>seg</gi> element may be
                            used to mark them. These two elements are described as follows: <specList>
                            <specDesc key="anchor"/>
                            <specDesc key="seg"/>
                            </specList> </p>
                        <p>In the following example, <gi>ref</gi> elements have been used to
                            represent points in this text which are to be linked in some way to
                            other parts of it; in the first case to a point, and in the second, to a
                            sequence of words: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                            Returning to <ref target="#ABCD">the point where I dozed off</ref>, I
                            noticed that <ref target="#EFGH">three words</ref> had been circled in
                            red by a previous reader</egXML> </p>
                        <p>This encoding requires that elements with the specified identifiers
                            (<val>ABCD</val> and <val>EFGH</val> in this example) are to be found
                            somewhere else in the current document. Assuming that no element already
                            exists to carry these identifiers, the <gi>anchor</gi> and <gi>seg</gi>
                            elements may be used: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                            .... <anchor type="bookmark" xml:id="ABCD"/> .... ....<seg type="target"
                            xml:id="EFGH"> ... </seg> ...</egXML> </p>
                        <p>The <att>type</att> attribute should be used (as above) to distinguish
                            amongst different purposes for which these general purpose elements
                            might be used in a text. Some other uses are discussed in section <ptr

                        <p>So far, we have shown how the <gi>ref</gi> element may be used for
                            cross-references or links whose targets occur within the same document
                            as their source. The element may also be used to refer to elements in
                            any other XML document or resource, such as a document on the web, or a
                            database component. This is possible because the value of the
                            <att>target</att> attribute may be any valid <term>Uniform Resource
                            Identifier</term> (URI)<note place="foot">A full definition of this
                            term, defined by the W3C (the consortium which manages the development
                            and maintenance of the World Wide Web), is beyond the scope of this
                            tutorial: however, the most frequently encountered version of a URI is
                            the familiar URL used to indicate a web page, such as
                            <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code> </note>. </p>
                        <p>A URI may reference a web page or just a part of one, for example
                            <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml#SEC2</code>. The hash sign
                            indicates that what follows it is the identifier of an element to be
                            located within the XML document identified by what precedes it: this
                            example will therefore locate an element which has an <att>xml:id</att>
                            attribute value of <val>SEC2</val> within the document retrieved from
                            <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code>. In the examples we have
                            discussed so far, the part to the left of the sharp sign has been
                            omitted: this is understood to mean that the referenced element is to be
                            located within the current document.</p>
                        <p>It is also possible to define an abbreviated form of the URI, using a
                            predefined <term>prefix</term> separated from the rest of the code by a
                            colon, as for example <val>cesr:SEC2</val>. This is known as a
                            <term>private URI</term>, since the prefix is not standardized (except
                            that the prefix <val>xml:</val> is reserved for use by XML itself). A
                            <gi>prefixDef</gi> element should be supplied within the TEI header
                            specifying how the prefix (here <val>cesr</val>) should be translated to
                            give a full URL for the link. This is particularly useful if a document
                            contains many references to an external document such as an authority
                            file. </p>
                        <p>Parts of an XML document can be specified by means of other more
                            sophisticated mechanisms using a language called Xpointer, also defined
                            by the W3C. This is useful when, for example, the elements to be linked
                            to do not bear identifiers. Further information about this and other
                            forms of link addressing is provided in <ref

                            <item>links an element with one or more other corresponding
                                elements.</item>
                            <label> <att>next</att> </label>
                            <item>links an element to the next element in an aggregate.</item>

                        <p>The <att>ana</att> (analysis) attribute is intended for use where a set
                            of abstract analyses or interpretations have been defined somewhere
                            within a document, as further discussed in section <ptr
                            target="#Simple-anal"/>. For example, a linguistic analysis of the
                            sentence <q>John loves Nancy</q> might be encoded as follows: <egXML
                            xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <seg ana="#SVO"
                            type="sentence"> <seg ana="#NP1" type="lex">John</seg> <seg ana="#VVI"
                            type="lex">loves</seg> <seg ana="#NP1" type="lex">Nancy</seg> </seg>
                            </egXML> This encoding implies the existence elsewhere in the document
                            of elements with identifiers <val>SVO</val>, <val>NP1</val>, and
                            <val>VV1</val> where the significance of these particular codes is
                            explained. Note the use of the <gi>seg</gi> element to mark particular
                            components of the analysis, distinguished by the <att>type</att>
                            attribute.</p>
                        <p>The <att>corresp</att> (corresponding) attribute provides a simple way of
                            representing some form of correspondence between two elements in a text.
                            For example, in a multilingual text, it may be used to link translation
                            equivalents, as in the following example: <egXML
                            xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <seg corresp="#EN1"
                            xml:id="FR1" xml:lang="fr">Jean aime Nancy</seg> <seg corresp="#FR1"
                            xml:id="EN1" xml:lang="en">John loves Nancy</seg> </egXML> </p>
                        <p>The same mechanism may be used for a variety of purposes. In the
                            following example, it has been used to represent the correspondences
                            between <q>the show</q> and <q>Shirley</q>, and between <q>NBC</q> and
                            <q>the network</q>: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <p>
                            <title xml:id="shirley">Shirley</title>, which made its Friday night
                            debut only a month ago, was not listed on <name xml:id="nbc"
                            >NBC</name>'s new schedule, although <seg corresp="#nbc"

                        <p>The <att>next</att> and <att>prev</att> attributes provide a simple way
                            of linking together the components of a discontinuous element, as in the
                            following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <q

                            saying, the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the

                    <p>The following elements may be used to mark <term>corrections</term>, that is
                        editorial changes introduced where the editor believes the original to be
                        erroneous: <specList>

                    <p>The following elements may be used to mark <term>normalization</term>, that
                        is editorial changes introduced for the sake of consistency or modernization
                        of a text: <specList>

                    <p>Consider, for example, the following famous passage as it appears in the
                        first quarto printing of Shakespeare's <title>Henry V</title>: <figure>

                    <p>A modern editor might wish to make a number of interventions here,
                        specifically to modernize (or normalize) the Elizabethan spellings of
                        <mentioned>a'</mentioned> and <mentioned>sharpe</mentioned> for
                        <mentioned>he</mentioned> and <mentioned>sharp</mentioned> respectively.
                        They might also want to emend <mentioned>table</mentioned> to
                        <mentioned>babbl'd</mentioned>, following an editorial tradition that goes
                        back to the 18th century Shakespearian scholar Lewis Theobald. The following
                        encoding would then be appropriate: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his Nose was as
                        <reg>sharp</reg> as a Pen and <reg>he</reg> <corr resp="#Theobald"
                        >babbl'd</corr> of green fields</egXML> </p>
                    <p>A more conservative or source-oriented editor, however, might want to retain
                        the original, but at the same time signal that some of the readings it
                        contains are in some sense anomalous: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his Nose was as
                        <orig>sharpe</orig> as a Pen, and <orig>a</orig> <sic>Table</sic> of green
                        fields</egXML> </p>
                    <p>Finally, a modern digital editor may decide to combine both possibilities in
                        a single composite text, using the <gi>choice</gi> element. <specList>
                        <specDesc key="choice"/>
                        </specList> This allows an editor to indicate where alternative encodings
                        are possible: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his
                        Nose was as <choice> <orig>sharpe</orig> <reg>sharp</reg> </choice> as a

                    <p>In addition to correcting or normalizing words and phrases, editors and
                        transcribers may also supply missing material, omit material, or transcribe
                        material deleted or crossed out in the source. In addition, some material
                        may be particularly hard to transcribe because it is hard to make out on the
                        page. The following elements may be used to record such phenomena: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="add"/>
                        <specDesc key="gap"/>

                        <specDesc key="subst"/>
                        </specList> </p>
                    <p>These elements may be used to record changes made by an editor, by the
                        transcriber, or (in manuscript material) by the author or scribe. For
                        example, if the source for an electronic text read <q>The following elements
                        are provided for for simple editorial interventions.</q> then it might be
                        felt desirable to correct the obvious error, but at the same time to record
                        the deletion of the superfluous second <mentioned>for</mentioned>, thus:
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">The following elements are
                        provided for <del resp="#LB">for</del> simple editorial
                        interventions.</egXML> The attribute value <val>#LB</val> on the
                        <att>resp</att> attribute is used to point to a fuller definition (typically
                        in a <gi>respStmt</gi> element) of the person or other agency responsible
                        for correcting the duplication of <mentioned>for</mentioned>.</p>
                    <p>If the source read <q>The following elements provided for simple editorial
                        interventions.</q> (i.e. if the word <mentioned>are</mentioned> had been
                        inadvertently dropped) then the scholar identified as <val>LB</val> might
                        choose to encode the corrected text as follows: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">The following elements <add
                        resp="#LB">are</add> provided for simple editorial interventions.</egXML> </p>
                    <p>These elements may also be used to record the actual writing process, for
                        example to record passages which have been deleted, added, corrected etc.,
                        whether by the author of a literary text or by a scribe copying out a
                        manuscript. An analysis of such documentary modifications may be essential
                        before a reading text can be presented, and is clearly of importance in the
                        editorial process. </p>
                    <p>The example is taken from the surviving authorial manuscript of a poem by the
                        English writer Wilfred Owen, a part of which is shown here: </p>

                        </head>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Owen first wrote <q>Helping the worst amongst us</q>, but then deleted it,
                        adding <q>Dragging the worst amongt us</q> over the top. In the same way, he
                        revised the phrase <q>half–blind</q> by deleting the <q>half–</q> and adding
                        <q>all</q> above it. In the last line, he started a word beginning
                        <q>fif</q> before deleting it and writing the word <q>five–nines</q>. We can
                        encode all of this as follows: </p>
                    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <l>And towards our distant rest
                        began to trudge,</l> <l> <subst> <del>Helping the worst amongst us</del>
                        <add>Dragging the worst amongt us</add> </subst>, who’d no boots </l> <l>But
                        limped on, blood–shod. All went lame; <subst> <del status="shortEnd"

                        that dropped behind.</l> </egXML>
                    <p>The tags <gi>add</gi> and <gi>del</gi> elements are used to enclose passages
                        added or deleted respectively. Additional attributes are available such as
                        <att>resp</att> to indicate responsibility for the modification, or
                        <att>place</att> to indicate where in the text (for example, above or below
                        the line) the modification has been made. Where the encoder wishes to assert
                        that the addition and deletion make up a single editorial act of
                        substitution, these elements can be combined within a <gi>subst</gi> element
                        as shown above.</p>
                    <p>A very careful examination of Owen’s second modification shows that he really
                        did write <q>amongt</q> rather than <q>amongst</q>, presumably in error. An
                        equally careful editor wishing to restore the missing <q>s</q> might use the
                        <gi>supplied</gi> element to indicate that they have done so:</p>
                    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <add>Dragging the worst
                        among<supplied resp="#ED">s</supplied>t us</add> </egXML>
                    <p>Here the <att>resp</att> attribute has been used to indicate that the
                        <q>s</q> was not supplied by Owen but by someone else, specifically the
                        person documented elsewhere by an element with the identifier <val>ED</val>. </p>
                    <p>The <gi>unclear</gi> element is useful where material in the source is so
                        hard to read that the transcriber is uncertain as to whether they have done
                        so correctly. It The <gi>gap</gi> element by contrast should be used where
                        the material is so illegible that the transcriber does not wish even to
                        attempt it. The two may however be used together as in the following
                        example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">One hundred &amp;
                        twenty good regulars joined <unclear>to me <gap extent="2 words"
                        reason="indecipherable"/> and </unclear> instantly, would aid me signally in
                        an enterprise against Wilmington.</egXML> </p>
                    <p>The <gi>del</gi> element marks material which is deleted in a source, but has
                        been transcribed as part of the electronic text all the same, while
                        <gi>gap</gi> marks the location of source material which is omitted from the
                        electronic text, whether it is legible or not. A language corpus, for
                        example, might omit long quotations in foreign languages. An
                        <att>extent</att> attribute is available on the <gi>gap</gi> element to
                        indicate how much material has been omitted. The <gi>desc</gi> element can
                        be used inside the <gi>gap</gi> element to provide a brief characterisation
                        of the omitted material, as in the following examples: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <p> ... An example of a list

                    <head>Abbreviation and their Expansion</head>
                    <p>Like names, dates, and numbers, abbreviations may be transcribed as they
                        stand or expanded; they may be left unmarked, or encoded using the following
                        elements: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="abbr"/>
                        <specDesc key="expan"/>
                        </specList> </p>
                    <p>The <gi>abbr</gi> element is useful as a means of distinguishing semi-lexical
                        items such as acronyms or jargon: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Every manufacturer of
                        <abbr>3GL</abbr> or <abbr>4GL</abbr> languages is currently nailing on
                        <abbr>OOP</abbr> extensions</egXML> </p>
                    <p>The <att>type</att> attribute may be used to distinguish types of
                        abbreviation by their function. </p>
                    <p>The <gi>expan</gi> element is used to mark an expansion supplied by an
                        encoder. This element is particularly useful in the transcription of
                        manuscript materials. For example, the character p with a bar through its
                        descender as a conventional representation for the word <val>per</val> is
                        commonly encountered in Medieval European manuscripts. An encoder may choose
                        to expand this as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                        <expan>per</expan> </egXML> </p>
                    <p>To record both an abbreviation and its expansion, the <gi>choice</gi> element
                        mentioned above may be used to group the abbreviated form with its proposed
                        expansion: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <choice>
                        <abbr>wt</abbr> <expan>with</expan> </choice> </egXML> </p>
                    <p>The elements <gi>expan</gi> and <gi>abbr</gi> should contain a full word, or
                        the abbreviated form of a full word respectively.
                        <!--If it is required to tag smaller
            components of an abbreviated word, the following elements are also available in TEI

                    <p>A <term>referring string</term> is any phrase which refers to some person,
                        place, object, etc. A <term>name</term> is a referring string which contains
                        proper nouns and honorifics only. Two elements are provided to mark such
                        strings: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="rs"/>
                        <specDesc key="name"/>
                        </specList> </p>
                    <p>The <att>type</att> attribute is used to distinguish amongst (for example)
                        names of persons, places and organizations, where this is possible: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <q>My dear <name type="person">Mr.
                        Bennet</name>, </q>said his lady to him one day, <q>have you heard that
                        <name type="place">Netherfield Park</name> is let at last?</q> </egXML>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">It being one of the
                        principles of the <name type="organization">Circumlocution Office</name>
                        never, on any account whatsoever, to give a straightforward answer, <name
                        type="person">Mr Barnacle</name> said, <q>Possibly.</q> </egXML> </p>
                    <p>As the following example shows, the <gi>rs</gi> element may be used for a
                        reference to a person, place, etc., which does not contain a proper noun or
                        noun phrase: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <q>My dear
                        <name type="person">Mr. Bennet</name>,</q> said <rs type="person">his
                        lady</rs> to him one day...</egXML> </p>
                    <p>Simply tagging something as a name is rarely enough to enable automatic
                        processing of personal names into the canonical forms usually required for
                        reference purposes. The name as it appears in the text may be inconsistently
                        spelled, partial, or vague. Moreover, name prefixes such as
                        <mentioned>van</mentioned> or <mentioned>de la</mentioned>, may or may not
                        be included as part of the reference form of a name, depending on the
                        language and country of origin of the bearer.</p>
                    <p>The <att>ref</att> attribute provides a way of linking a name with a
                        description of the object being named, and may thus act as a normalized
                        identifier for it. It is also very useful as a means of gathering together
                        all references to the same individual or location scattered throughout a
                        document: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <q>My dear <name
                        ref="#BENM1" type="person">Mr. Bennet</name>, </q> said <rs ref="#BENM2"
                        type="person">his lady</rs> to him one day, <q>have you heard that <name
                        ref="#NETP1" type="place">Netherfield Park</name> is let at last?</q>
                        </egXML> </p>
                    <p>The values used for the <att>ref</att> attribute here (<val>#BENM1</val>
                        etc.) are pointers; in this case indicating an element with the identifier
                        <val>BENM1</val> etc. somewhere in the current document, though any form of
                        URI could be used. The element indicated will typically (for a person) be a
                        <gi>person</gi> element, listed within a <gi>particDesc</gi> element, or
                        (for a place) a <gi>place</gi> element, listed within a <gi>settingDesc</gi>
                        element in the TEI header, as further discussed in <ptr target="#profDesc"/>
                        below.</p>
                    <p>This use should be distinguished from the case of the <gi>reg</gi>
                        (regularization) element, which provides a means of marking the standard
                        form of a referencing string as demonstrated below: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <name ref="#WADLM1" type="person">
                        <choice> <orig>Walter de la Mare</orig> <reg>de la Mare, Walter</reg>

                </div>
                <div xml:id="code">
                    <head>Formulae, Codes, and Special Characters</head>
                    <p>The following elements may be useful when marking up sequences of text that
                        represent mathematical expressions, chemical formulae, and the like: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="formula"/>
                        <specDesc key="g"/>
                        </specList> </p>
                    <p>In many cases, a simple Unicode character suffices to represent the
                        superscript or subscript digits and other symbols which may appear inside a
                        mathematical formula: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                        <formula>E=mc²</formula> </egXML> In other more complex cases, the encoder
                        may choose to use a different XML scheme (such as MathML) to encode the
                        content of a formula, or a non-XML notation. These possibilities are not
                        discussed further here. </p>
                    <p>The <gi>g</gi> element is useful in the case that no Unicode character exists
                        to represent the character or glyph required. Its <att>ref</att> attribute
                        can be used to point to a definition of the symbol intended, while its
                        content (if any) represents a Unicode approximation to it: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">...Thereto <g ref="#air">[air]</g>
                        and ... </egXML> The TEI header provides a number of additional elements for
                        the definition of such non-Unicode characters, as further discussed in
                        section <ptr target="#chardecl"/> below. </p>
                    <p>The following elements are useful for stretches of code or similar formal
                        language appearing within a text: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="code"/>
                        <specDesc key="email"/>

                    <p>Note in this example that characters which have a syntactic function in XML
                        (such as the ampersand or the angle bracket) must be represented within a

                    <p>The following elements are provided for the detailed encoding of times and
                        dates: <specList>

                    <p>These elements have a number of attributes which can be used to provide
                        normalized versions of their values in various ways. <specList>
                        <specDesc atts="period when notBefore notAfter" key="att.datable"/>
                        </specList> The <att>when</att> attribute specifies a normalized form for
                        the date or time, using one of the standard formats defined by ISO 8601.
                        Partial dates or times (e.g. <q>1990</q>, <q>September 1990</q>,
                        <q>twelvish</q>) can be expressed by omitting a part of the value supplied,
                        as in the following examples: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <date when="1980-02-21">21 Feb

                        <!--Note in the last example the use of a
            normalized representation for the date string which includes a time: this example could
            thus equally well be tagged using the <gi>time</gi> element.--> </p>
                    <p>These attributes are typically used to make a date or time more easily
                        processable, as in the following examples: <egXML

                        </l> </egXML> They are also useful in cases where the date concerned is
                        uncertain or only vaguely specified: <egXML

                <div>
                    <head>Numbers and Measurements</head>
                    <p>Like dates, both numbers and quantities can be written with either letters or
                        digits and may therefore need to be normalized for ease of processing. Their
                        presentation is also highly language-dependent (e.g. English
                        <mentioned>5th</mentioned> becomes Greek <mentioned>5.</mentioned>; English
                        <mentioned>123,456.78</mentioned> equals French
                        <mentioned>123.456,78</mentioned>). </p>
                    <p>The following elements are provided for the detailed encoding of numbers and

                <p>The element <gi>list</gi> is used to mark any kind of <term>list</term>. A list
                    is a sequence of text items, which may be numbered, bulleted, or arranged as a
                    glossary list. Each item may be preceded by an item label (in a glossary list,
                    this label is the term being defined): <specList>
                    <specDesc key="list"/>
                    <specDesc key="item"/>
                    <specDesc key="label"/>
                    </specList> </p>
                <p>Individual list items are tagged with <gi>item</gi>. The first <gi>item</gi> may
                    optionally be preceded by a <gi>head</gi>, which gives a heading for the list.
                    The numbering of items within the list may be omitted, indicated using the
                    <att>n</att> attribute on each item, or (rarely) tagged as content using the
                    <gi>label</gi> element. The following are all thus equivalent: <egXML

                <p>Lists of bibliographic items should be tagged using the <gi>listBibl</gi>
                    element, described in the next section.</p>

                <head>Bibliographic Citations</head>
                <p>It is often useful to distinguish bibliographic citations where they occur within
                    texts being transcribed for research, if only so that they will be properly
                    formatted when the text is printed out. The element <gi>bibl</gi> is provided
                    for this purpose. Where the components of a bibliographic reference are to be
                    distinguished, the following elements may be used as appropriate. It is
                    generally useful to distinguish at least those parts (such as the titles of
                    articles, books, and journals) which will need special formatting. The other
                    elements are provided for cases where particular interest attaches to such
                    details: <specList>
                    <specDesc key="bibl"/>
                    <specDesc key="author"/>
                    <specDesc key="biblScope"/>
                    <specDesc key="date"/>
                    <specDesc key="editor"/>
                    <specDesc key="publisher"/>

                <p>Consider, for example the following editorial note: <q rend="display">He was a
                    member of Parliament for Warwickshire in 1445, and died March 14, 1470
                    (according to Kittredge, <title>Harvard Studies</title> 5. 88ff).</q> This might
                    be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">He was a
                    member of Parliament for Warwickshire in 1445, and died March 14, 1470
                    (according to <bibl> <author>Kittredge</author>, <title>Harvard Studies</title>

                <p>The bibliographic elements listed above are particularly useful in a born digital
                    document which contains a bibliography encoded using the <gi>listBibl</gi>
                    element. Entries in the bibliography should be given an identifier, which can
                    then be used as the target of cross references from elsewhere in the document:
                    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <p>Perec citing, amongst others
                    <ref target="#MK_73">Sturm und Drang, 1973</ref>, concludes ... </p> </egXML> </p>
                <p> A <gi>bibl</gi> element may contain simply text, with possibly a few of its
                    components distinguished by tagging, and much use of conventionalized
                    punctuation, as in this example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                    > <bibl xml:id="MK_73">Sturm, U. &amp; Drang, F. : <title>Musikalische
                    Katastrophe</title>. (Berlin, W. de Gruyter, 1973)</bibl> </egXML>
                    Alternatively, each of the components of the bibliographic reference may be
                    clearly distinguished by tagging; in this case there is no requirement for
                    conventionalized punctuation, since the processor will be able to generate this
                    appropriately: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <bibl
                    xml:id="MK73"> <author>Sturm, U.</author> <author>Drang, F.</author> <title

                <p>Not all the components of a document are necessarily textual. The most
                    straightforward text will often contain diagrams or illustrations, to say
                    nothing of documents in which image and text are inextricably intertwined, or
                    electronic resources in which the two are complementary. </p>
                <p>The encoder may simply record the presence of a graphic within the text, possibly
                    with a brief description of its content, and may also provide a link to a
                    digitized version of the graphic, using the following elements: <specList>
                    <specDesc key="graphic"/>
                    <specDesc key="figure"/>
                    <specDesc key="figDesc"/>
                    </specList> </p>
                <p>Any textual information accompanying the graphic, such as a heading and/or
                    caption, may be included within the <gi>figure</gi> element itself, in a
                    <gi>head</gi> and one or more <gi>p</gi> elements, as may any text appearing
                    within the graphic itself. It is strongly recommended that a prose description
                    of the image be supplied, as the content of a <gi>figDesc</gi> element, for the
                    use of applications which are not able to render the graphic, and to render the
                    document accessible to vision-impaired readers. (Such text is not normally
                    considered part of the document proper.)</p>
                <p>The simplest use for these elements is to mark the position of a graphic and
                    provide a link to it, as in this example: <egXML
                    xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <pb n="412"/> <figure>
                    <graphic url="images/p412fig.png"/>
                    </figure> <pb n="413"/> </egXML> This indicates that the graphic contained by
                    the file <ident>p412fig.png</ident> appears between pages 412 and 413. </p>
                <p>The <gi>graphic</gi> element can appear anywhere that textual content is
                    permitted, within but not between paragraphs or headings. In the following
                    example, the encoder has decided to treat a specific printer's ornament as a
                    heading: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <head> <graphic
                    url="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/gants/Ornaments/Heads/hp-ral02.gif"/> </head>
                    </egXML> </p>
                <p>More usually, a graphic will have at the least an identifying title, which may be
                    encoded using the <gi>head</gi> element, or a number of figures may be grouped
                    together in a particular structure, as in the following example: <figure>
                    <graphic url="../Images/fezziPic.png"/>
                    <head> <title>Mr Fezziwig's Ball</title>: illustration by George Cruikshank from
                        Dickens' <title>A Christmas Carol</title> (1843) </head>
                    </figure> The <gi>figure</gi> element provides a means of wrapping one or more
                    such elements together as a kind of graphic <soCalled>block</soCalled>. It may
                    also include a brief description of the image: <egXML
                    xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <figure>
                    <graphic url="images/fezzipic.png"/>
                    <head>Mr Fezziwig's Ball</head>
                    <figDesc>A Cruikshank engraving showing Mr Fezziwig leading a group of
                        revellers.</figDesc>
                    </figure> </egXML> </p>
                <p>These cases should be carefully distinguished from the case where an encoded text
                    is complemented by a collection of digital images, maintained as a distinct
                    resource. The <att>facs</att> attribute may be used to associate any element in
                    an encoded text with a digital facsimile of it. In the simplest case, the
                    <att>facs</att> attribute on the <gi>pb</gi> element may be used to supply a
                    location for an image file corresponding with that point in the text: <egXML
                    xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <div>
                    <pb facs="page1.png" n="1"/>
                    <!-- text contained on page 1 is encoded here -->
                    <pb facs="page2.png" n="2"/>
                    <!-- text contained on page 2 is encoded here -->
                    </div> </egXML> This method is only appropriate in the simple case where each
                    digital image file <ident>page1.png</ident> etc. corresponds with a single
                    transcribed and encoded page. If multiple images are provided for each page, or
                    more detailed alignment of image and transcription is required, for example
                    because the image files actually represent double page spreads, more
                    sophisticated mechanisms are needed, as further discussed in <ptr
                    target="#Simple-fax"/> below. </p>

                    <p>Interpretation typically ranges across the whole of a text, with no
                        particular respect to other structural units. A useful preliminary to
                        intensive interpretation is therefore to segment the text into discrete and
                        identifiable units, each of which can then bear a label for use as a sort of
                        <soCalled>canonical reference</soCalled>. To facilitate such uses, these
                        units may not cross each other, nor nest within each other. They may
                        conveniently be represented using the following element: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="s"/>
                        </specList> </p>
                    <p>As the name suggests, the <gi>s</gi> element is most commonly used (in
                        linguistic applications at least) for marking <term>orthographic
                        sentences</term>, that is, units defined by orthographic features such as
                        punctuation. For example, the passage from <title>Jane Eyre</title>
                        discussed earlier might be divided into s-units as follows: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <div n="38" type="chapter">
                        <pb n="474"/>
                        <p> <s n="001">Reader, I married him.</s> <s n="002">A quiet wedding we
                            had:</s> <s n="003">he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone
                            present.</s> <s n="004">When we got back from church, I went into the
                            kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner, and John
                            cleaning the knives, and I said —</s> </p>
                        <p> <q> <s n="005">Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this
                            morning.</s> </q> ... </p>
                        </div> </egXML> Note that <gi>s</gi> elements cannot nest: the beginning of
                        one <gi>s</gi> element implies that the previous one has finished. When
                        s-units are tagged as shown above, it is advisable to tag the entire text
                        end-to-end, so that every word in the text being analyzed will be contained
                        by exactly one <gi>s</gi> element, whose identifier can then be used to
                        specify a unique reference for it. If the identifiers used are unique within
                        the document, then the <att>xml:id</att> attribute might be used in
                        preference to the <att>n</att> attribute used in the above example.</p>

                    <head>Words and Punctuation</head>
                    <p>Tokenization, that is, the identification of lexical or non-lexical tokens
                        within a text, is a very common requirement for all kinds of textual
                        analysis, and not an entirely trivial one. The decision as to whether, for
                        example, <q>can't</q> in English or <q>du</q> in French should be treated as
                        one word or two is not simple. Consequently it is often useful to make
                        explicit the preferred tokenization in a marked up text. The following
                        elements are available for this purpose: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="w"/>
                        <specDesc key="c"/>
                        <specDesc key="pc"/>
                        </specList> </p>
                    <p>For example, the output from a part of speech tagger might be recorded in TEI
                        simplePrint as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <s
                        n="1"> <w ana="#NP0">Marley</w> <w ana="#VBD">was</w> <w ana="#AJ0">dead</w>
                        <pc>:</pc> <w ana="#TO0">to</w> <w ana="#VBB">begin</w> <w ana="#PRP"
                        >with</w> <pc ana="#SENT">.</pc> </s> </egXML> </p>
                    <p>In this example, each token in the input has been decorated with an
                        automatically generated part of speech code, using the <att>ana</att>
                        attribute discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> above. The system has
                        also distinguished between tokens to be treated as words (tagged <gi>w</gi>)
                        and tokens considered to be punctuation (tagged <gi>pc</gi>). It may also
                        sometimes be useful to distinguish tokens which consist of a single letter
                        or character: the <gi>c</gi> element is provided for this purpose.
                        <!-- some crazy people mark up interword space with a c: shd that be mentioned? --> </p>
                    <p>The <gi>w</gi> also provides for each word to be associated with a root form
                        or lemma, either explicitly using the <att>lemma</att> attribute, or by
                        reference, using the <att>lemmaRef</att> attribute, as in this example:
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">...<w ana="#VBD" lemma="be"
                        lemmaRef="http://www.myLexicon.com/be">was</w> ... </egXML> </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <head>General-Purpose Interpretation Elements</head>
                    <p>The <gi>w</gi> element is a specialisation of the <gi>seg</gi> element which
                        has already been introduced for use in identifying otherwise unmarked
                        targets of cross references and hypertext links (see section <ptr
                        target="#Simple-ptrs"/>); it can be used to distinguish any portion of text
                        to which the encoder wishes to assign a user-specified <att>type</att> or a
                        unique identifier; it may thus be used to tag textual features for which
                        there is no other provision in the published TEI Guidelines.</p>
                    <p>For example, the TEI Guidelines provide no <soCalled>apostrophe</soCalled>
                        element to mark parts of a literary text in which the narrator addresses the
                        reader (or hearer) directly. One approach might be to regard these as
                        instances of the <gi>q</gi> element, distinguished from others by an
                        appropriate value for the <att>who</att> attribute. A possibly simpler, and
                        certainly more general, solution would however be to use the <gi>seg</gi>
                        element as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <div
                        n="38" type="chapter">
                        <p> <seg type="apostrophe">Reader, I married him.</seg> A quiet wedding we
                            had: ...</p>
                        </div> </egXML> The <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>seg</gi> element
                        can take any value, and so can be used to distinguish phrase-level phenomena
                        of any kind; it is good practice to record the values used and their
                        significance in the TEI header or in the documentation of the encoding
                        system. <!-- mention ODD! --> </p>

                <head>Common Attributes</head>
                <p>Some attributes are available on many elements, though not on all. These
                    attributes are defined using a TEI attribute class, a concept which is discussed
                    further in the TEI Guidelines. We list here some attribute classes which have
                    been adapted or customized for use in TEI simplePrint. </p>
                <p>The elements <gi>add</gi>, <gi>figure</gi>, <gi>fw</gi>, <gi>label</gi>,
                    <gi>note</gi> and <gi>stage</gi> all take the attribute <att>place</att> to
                    indicate whereabouts on the page they appear. In TEI simplePrint the possible
                    values for this attribute are limited as indicated below: <specList>

                <p>A different kind of composite text occurs when one text is embedded within
                    another, as for example in the <title>Arabian Nights</title> or similar
                    collections of stories, or in other cases where one narrative is interrupted by
                    another. The element <gi>floatingText</gi> may be preferred to encode such
                    materials as the following: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                <p>Note that there is only a single TEI header for composite texts of either kind,
                    since the assumption is that the composite is at some level describable as a
                    single work. However, it is also possible to define a composite of complete TEI
                    texts, each with its own TEI header. Such a collection is known as a <term>TEI
                    corpus</term>, and must itself have a TEI header: <egXML valid="feasible"
                    xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <teiCorpus> <teiHeader>

                    possible to create a composite of corpora -- that is, one <gi>teiCorpus</gi>
                    element may contain many nested <gi>teiCorpus</gi> elements rather than many

                            following elements are provided: <specList>

                <head>Encoding a Digital Facsimile</head>
                <p>The following elements may be used to encode a text represented by a collection
                    of digital images, either alone or in conjunction with a textual transcription. <specList>
                    <specDesc key="facsimile"/>

                <p>As mentioned in section <ptr target="#Simple-figs"/> above, a TEI simplePrint
                    document may reference a set of page images, alone, or in combination with a
                    transcription. For ease of management, it is strongly recommended that the
                    <gi>graphic</gi> elements representing those page images be grouped together
                    within a <gi>facsimile</gi> element, as in the following example: <egXML
                    xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <facsimile> <graphic url="page1.png"
                    xml:id="page1"/> <graphic url="page2.png" xml:id="page2"/> </facsimile> </egXML>
                    If a transcription is supplied in addition, the <att>xml:id</att> values can be
                    used to align the page breaks within it with the relevant image, rather than
                    using the URL given on the <gi>graphic</gi> element. <egXML
                    xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <text>
                    <!-- ...-->
                    <pb facs="#page1"/>
                    <!-- text contained on page 1 -->
                    <pb facs="#page2"/>
                    <!-- text contained on page 2 -->
                    <!-- ...-->
                    </text> </egXML> </p>
                <p>The <gi>surface</gi> element is useful in two situations: when it is desired to
                    group different images of the same page, for example of different resolutions;
                    and when it is desired to align parts of a page image with parts of a
                    transcription. The <gi>zone</gi> element is used to define (and hence provide an
                    identifier for) the location of a part of an image with reference to the surface
                    on which it appears. </p>
                <p>In this example, a thumbnail and a high resolution image are associated with the
                    same surface: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <facsimile>
                    <surface> <graphic url="thumbs/page1.png" xml:id="page1T"/> <graphic
                    url="page1.png" xml:id="page1"/> </surface> </facsimile> </egXML> </p>
                <p>In this example, the <gi>head</gi> element in the transcription is aligned with
                    the top half of a square image: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                    <facsimile> <surface lrx="4" lry="4" ulx="1" uly="1"> <graphic url="page1.png"
                    xml:id="page1"/> <zone lrx="2" lry="4" ulx="1" uly="1" xml:id="topHalfP1"/>
                    </surface> </facsimile> <text>
                    <body>
                        <!-- ... -->
                        <pb facs="#page1"/>
                        <head facs="#topHalfP1">Text of Heading</head>

                    </body>
                    </text> </egXML> </p>
                <p>A more detailed explanation of the use of these attributes and other associated
                    elements is given in the full TEI Guidelines. </p>

                        <p>When it does not consist simply of a prose description, the
                            <gi>tagsDecl</gi> element may contain a number of more specialized
                            elements providing additional information about how the document
                            concerned has been marked up. The following elements may be used: <specList>
                            <specDesc key="rendition"/>
                            <specDesc key="namespace"/>

                            </specList> </p>
                        <p>Here is a simple example, showing how these elements may be used. It
                            indicates the number of times the elements <gi>hi</gi> and
                            <gi>title</gi> from the TEI namespace have been used in the document. It
                            also documents how the way that the source document was originally
                            printed has been represented using TEI tagging: <egXML

                            <rendition xml:id="rend-bo">font-weight:bold</rendition>
                            <rendition selector="hi, title" xml:id="rend-it"

                        <p>The <gi>rendition</gi> elements here contain fragments expressed in the
                            W3C standard Cascading Stylesheets language (CSS). Their function here
                            is to associate the particular styles concerned with an identifier (for
                            example <ident>rend-bo</ident>) which can then be pointed to from
                            elsewhere within the document by means of the <att>rendition</att>
                            attribute mentioned in section <ptr target="#faces"/> above. To
                            indicate, for example, that a particular name in the document was
                            rendered in a bold font it might be tagged <tag>name
                            rendition="#rend-bo"</tag>. The <att>selector</att> attribute used in
                            the preceding example is used to indicate once for all a default
                            rendition value to be associated with several elements: in this example,
                            unless otherwise indicated, it is assumed that the content of each
                            <gi>hi</gi> and each <gi>title</gi> element was originally rendered
                            using an italic font. </p>
                        <p>For TEI simplePrint, a large set of such rendition definitions has been
                            predefined. The encoder is not therefore required to supply any detailed
                            declarations, but can refer to the predefined list using the following

                        <p>The <gi>refsDecl</gi> element is used to document the way in which any
                            standard referencing scheme built into the encoding works. In its
                            simplest form, it consists of prose description.</p>
                        <p>Example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <refsDecl>
                            <p>The <att>n</att> attribute on each <gi>div</gi> contains the
                            canonical reference for each division in the form XX.yyy where XX is the
                            book number in roman numeral and yyy is the section number in
                            arabic.</p> <p>Milestone tags refer to the edition of 1830 as E30 and
                            that of 1850 as E50.</p> </refsDecl> </egXML> </p>
                        <p>The <gi>listPrefixDef</gi> element contains one or more
                            <gi>prefixDef</gi> elements, each defining a prefix which has been used
                            to abbreviate references to other documents, for example as the value of
                            a <att>target</att> or other pointing attribute. The definition provides
                            information about how the prefix can be translated automatically into a
                            full URL, as in the following example: <egXML
                            xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <listPrefixDef>
                            <prefixDef ident="psn" matchPattern="([A-Z]+)"
                                replacementPattern="http://www.example.com/personography.xml#$1"/>
                            </listPrefixDef> </egXML> </p>
                        <p>In this case, a pointer value in the form <val>psn:MDH</val> would be
                            translated to <code>http://www.example.com/personography.xml#MDH</code>. </p>
                        <p>The <gi>classDecl</gi> element groups together definitions or sources for
                            any descriptive classification schemes or <term>taxonomies</term> used
                            by other parts of the header. These schemes may be defined in a number
                            of different ways, using one or more of the following elements: <specList>
                            <specDesc key="taxonomy"/>
                            <specDesc key="bibl"/>
                            <specDesc key="category"/>

                            </specList> </p>
                        <p>In the simplest case, the taxonomy may be defined by a bibliographic
                            reference, as in the following example: <egXML
                            xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <classDecl> <taxonomy
                            xml:id="LC-SH"> <bibl>Library of Congress Subject Headings </bibl>
                            </taxonomy> </classDecl> </egXML> </p>
                        <p>Alternatively, or in addition, the encoder may define a special purpose
                            classification scheme, as in the following example: <egXML
                            xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <taxonomy xml:id="B">

                    <p>The <gi>particDesc</gi> element is used to list descriptive information about

                        a novel or a play. It contains at least one <gi>listPerson</gi> element,
                        which contains individual <gi>person</gi> elements.<specList>
                        <specDesc key="listPerson"/>
                        <specDesc key="person"/>
                        </specList> For example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                    <p>In the same way, the <gi>settingDesc</gi> element can be used to list
                        descriptive information about the real or fictional places mentioned in a
                        text. It contains at least one <gi>listPlace</gi> element, which contains
                        individual <gi>place</gi> elements. <specList>
                        <specDesc key="listPlace"/>
                        <specDesc key="place"/>

                    <p>The full TEI Guidelines provide a rich range of additional elements to define
                        more structured information about persons and places; these are not however
                        available in TEI Simple.</p>
                    <p>The <gi>langUsage</gi> element is useful where a text contains many different
                        languages. It may contain <gi>language</gi> elements to document each
                        particular language used: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="language"/>
                        </specList> For example, a text containing predominantly text in French as
                        spoken in Quebec, but also smaller amounts of British and Canadian English
                        might be documented as follows: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <langUsage> <language
                        ident="fr-CA" usage="60">Québecois</language> <language ident="en-CA"
                        usage="20">Canadian Business English</language> <language ident="en-GB"
                        usage="20">British English</language> </langUsage> </egXML> </p>
                    <p>The <gi>textClass</gi> element classifies a text. This may be done with
                        reference to a classification system locally defined by means of the
                        <gi>classDecl</gi> element, or by reference to some externally defined
                        established scheme such as the Universal Decimal Classification. Texts may
                        also be classified using lists of keywords, which may themselves be drawn
                        from locally or externally defined control lists. The following elements are
                        used to supply such classifications: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="classCode"/>
                        <specDesc key="catRef"/>
                        <specDesc key="keywords"/>
                        </specList> </p>
                    <p>The simplest way of classifying a text is by means of the <gi>classCode</gi>
                        element. For example, a text with classification 410 in the Universal
                        Decimal Classification might be documented as follows: <egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <classCode
                        scheme="http://www.udc.org">410</classCode> </egXML> </p>
                    <p>When a classification scheme has been locally defined using the
                        <gi>taxonomy</gi> element discussed in the preceding subsection, the
                        <gi>catRef</gi> element should be used to reference it. To continue the
                        earlier example, a work classified in the Brown Corpus as <val>Press
                        reportage - Sunday</val> and also as <val>Religion</val> might be documented
                        as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <catRef
                        target="#B.A3 #B.D"/> </egXML> </p>
                    <p>The element <gi>keywords</gi> contains one or more keywords or phrases
                        identifying the topic or nature of a text, each tagged as a <gi>term</gi>.
                        As usual, the attribute <att>scheme</att> identifies the source from which
                        these terms are taken. For example, if the LC Subject Headings are used,
                        following declaration of that classification system in a <gi>taxonomy</gi>
                        element as above: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                        <textClass> <keywords scheme="#LCSH"> <term>English literature</term>
                        <term>History and criticism</term> <term>Data processing.</term> </keywords>
                        </textClass> </egXML> </p>
                    <p>Multiple classifications may be supplied using any of the mechanisms
                        described in this section.</p>

                    <head>Other forms of metadata</head>
                    <p>The TEI header was one of the first attempts to provide a full range of
                        metadata elements, but it is by no means the only standard now used for this
                        purpose. To facilitate the management of large digital collections and to
                        simplify interoperability of TEI and non-TEI resources, the following
                        element may be found useful: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="xenoData"/>
                        </specList> </p>
                    <p>A typical use for this element might be to store a set of descriptors
                        conforming to the Dublin Core standard in the TEI header rather than to
                        generate them automatically from the corresponding TEI elements. For
                        examples and discussion, see the TEI Guidelines at <ptr
                        target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD9"/>

                <div>
                    <head>The Revision Description</head>
                    <p>The <gi>revisionDesc</gi> element provides a change log in which each
                        significant change made to a text may be recorded. It is always the last
                        element in a <gi>teiHeader</gi> and contains the following elements: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="change"/>
                        <specDesc key="listChange"/>
                        </specList> </p>
                    <p>Each <gi>change</gi> element contains a brief description of a significant
                        change. The attributes <att>when</att> and <att>who</att> may be used to
                        identify when the change was carried out and the person responsible for it. </p>
                    <p>It is good practice (but not required) to group changes together within a
                        <gi>listChange</gi> element. </p>
                    <p>Example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <revisionDesc>
                        <listChange>
                            <change when="1991-11-11" who="#LB">deleted chapter 10</change>
                            <change when="1991-11-02" who="#MSM">completed first draft</change>
                        </listChange>
                        </revisionDesc> </egXML> </p>
                    <p>In a production environment it will usually be found preferable to use some
                        kind of automated system to track and record changes. Many such
                        <term>version control systems</term>, as they are known, can also be
                        configured to update the TEI header of a file automatically. </p>

                <head>The Simple Processing Model</head>
                <p>Unlike most other TEI customizations, TEI simplePrint includes documentation of
                    the intended processing associated with the majority of elements. As noted
                    above, the TEI provides components such as the <att>rendition</att> attribute to
                    indicate the appearance of particular parts of a document in the non-digital
                    source from which it is derived. With TEI simplePrint, it is also possible to
                    indicate how in general an element should be processed, in particular its
                    intended appearance when processed for display on a screen or on paper. This
                    ability derives from a number of capabilities recently added to the TEI
                    architecture for the specification of processing, which were developed as part
                    of the project that defined the TEI simplePrint schema.</p>
                <p>The key feature of this <soCalled>Processing Model</soCalled> is a notation that
                    allows the encoder to associate each element with one or more categories, which
                    we call its <term>behaviour</term>s. In addition, the Processing Model indicates
                    how the element should be rendered, possibly differently in differing
                    circumstances, using the W3C Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) mentioned above. It is
                    consequently much easier to develop processors for documents conforming to TEI
                    simplePrint, since the complexity of the task is much reduced.</p>
                <p>Twenty-five different behaviours are currently defined by the TEI Processing
                    Model. Their names indicate informally the categorization concerned, and should
                    be readily comprehensible for most programmers. The following table indicates
                    the TEI simplePrint elements associated with each:</p>

                                        describe the appearance of the source text, not necessarily
                                        to determine how that text should be presented on screen or

                                        that it not be used in conjunction with <att>rend</att>.

                                format, the value is expressed as two numbers separated by the
                                letter E. The first number, the significand (sometimes called the
                                mantissa) is given in decimal format, while the second is an
                                integer. The value is obtained by multiplying the mantissa by 10 the
                                number of times indicated by the integer. Thus the value represented
                                in decimal notation as 1000.0 might be represented in scientific

                                string 1/2.</p>

                                    to be TEI-conformant, a corresponding <gi>language</gi> element

                            <p>There are two exceptions to the above format. First, there are

                            <p>Second, an entire language tag can consist of only a private use
                                subtag. These tags start with <code>x-</code>, and do not need to
                                follow any further rules established by the IETF and endorsed by
                                these Guidelines. Like all language tags that make use of private

                                    trait d'union, lui-même suivi de sous-étiquettes additionnelles.
                                    Ces dernières existent pour tenir compte d'une future extension
                                    de la norme BCP 47, mais à l'heure actuelle de telles extensions
                                    ne sont pas utilisées.</item>
                                <label>usage privé</label>
                                <item>Une extension utilisant la sous-étiquette initiale de la
                                    lettre <mentioned>x</mentioned> (i.e., commençant par
                                    <code>x-</code>) n'a pas d'autre signification que celle
                                    négociée entre les parties impliquées. Ces sous-étiquettes
                                    doivent être utilisées avec beaucoup de prudence, car elles
                                    interfèrent avec l'interopérabilité que l'utilisation de la
                                    norme RFC 4646 vise à promouvoir. Pour qu'un document qui
                                    utilise ces sous-étiquettes soit conforme à la TEI, un élément
                                    <gi>language</gi> correspondant doit être présent dans l'en-tête
                                    TEI.</item>

                            <p>Il y a deux exceptions au format ci-dessus. Premièrement, il y a des
                                codes de langue dans le <ref
                                target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry"

                                ci-dessus, mais qui sont présents car ils ont été
                                <soCalled>hérités</soCalled> de spécifications antérieures.</p>
                            <p>En second lieu, une étiquette complète de langue peut consister
                                seulement en une sous-étiquette d'usage privé. Ces étiquettes
                                commencent par <code>x-</code> ; il n'est pas nécessaire qu'elles
                                suivent les autres règles établies par l'IETF et acceptées par les
                                présents Principes directeurs. Comme toutes les étiquettes de langue
                                qui utilisent des sous-étiquettes d'usage privé, la langue en
                                question doit être documentée dans un élément correspondant
                                <gi>language</gi> dans l'en-tête TEI.</p>

                                    <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of
                                        Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create
                                        accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image
                                        sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books
                                        Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The
                                        general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the
                                        first edition) of every monographic English-language title
                                        published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
                                    <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data
                                        within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and
                                        therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as
                                        opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly
                                        structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative
                                        (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
                                    <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363
                                        texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been
                                        released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone
                                        can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but
                                        we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is
                                        given to their original source.</p>
                                    <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP
                                        texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made
                                        about the data.</p>
                                    <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of
                                        English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an
                                        anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their
                                        works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to
                                        range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the
                                        true nature of the print record of the period. In general,
                                        first editions of a works in English were prioritized,
                                        although there are a number of works in other languages,
                                        notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or
                                        later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling
                                        reason to do so.</p>
                                    <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for
                                        transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then
                                        carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5%
                                        (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was
                                        proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA
                                        standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After
                                        proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and
                                        characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible
                                        up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining
                                        illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these
                                        processes should make clear that, while the overall quality
                                        of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some
                                        readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users
                                        should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances
                                        will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
                                    <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in
                                        accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries
                                        guidelines.</p>
                                    <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP
                                        schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities);
                                        displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either
                                        as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless

                                process. From a set of more or less instinctive rules of thumb a
                                formal discipline or "methodology" of database design has evolved.
                                Applying that methodology can be of great benefit to a very wide
                                range of academic subjects: it requires fundamental skills of
                                abstraction and generalisation and it provides a simple mechanism
                                whereby complex ideas and information structures can be represented
                                and manipulated, even without the use of a computer. </p>

                            <p>This example presumes that the prefix <code>dc</code> has been bound
                                to the namespace <code>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</code> and
                                the prefix <code>rdf</code> is bound to the namespace
                                <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#</code>. Note: The
                                <att>about</att> attribute on the <gi>rdf:Description</gi> in this
                                example gives a URI indicating the resource to which the metadata
                                contained therein refer. The <gi>rdf:Description</gi> in the second
                                <gi>xenoData</gi> block has a blank <att>about</att>, meaning it is
                                pointing at the <hi rend="italic">current</hi> document, so the RDF
                                is about the document within which it is contained, i.e. the TEI
                                document containing the <gi>xenoData</gi> block. Similarly, any kind
                                of relative URI may be used, including fragment identifiers (see
                                <ptr target="#SG-id"/>). Do note, however, that if the contents of
                                the <gi>xenoData</gi> block are to be extracted and used elsewhere,
                                any relative URIs will have to be resolved accordingly.</p>

                            <p>When a single page is being cited, use the <att>from</att> and
                                <att>to</att> attributes with an identical value. When no clear
                                endpoint is provided, the <att>from</att> attribute may be used
                                without <att>to</att>; for example a citation such as <q>p. 3ff</q>
                                might be encoded <code>&lt;biblScope from="3"&gt;p.
                                3ff&lt;biblScope&gt;</code>.</p>
                            <p>It is now considered good practice to supply this element as a
                                sibling (rather than a child) of <gi>imprint</gi>, since it supplies
                                information which does not constitute part of the imprint. </p>

                            <p>Wird nur eine einzelne Seite zitiert, erhalten die Attribute
                                <att>from</att> und <att>to</att> identische Werte. Gibt es keinen
                                klaren Endpunkt, sollte nur das <att>from</att>-Attribut ohne
                                korrespondierendes <att>to</att>-Attribut verwendet werden, zum
                                Beispiel könnte ein Zitat wie <q>S. 3ff.</q> als <code>&lt;biblScope
                                from="3"&gt;p. 3ff&lt;biblScope&gt;</code> kodiert werden.</p>
                            <p>Es wird nun als gute Praxis angesehen, dieses Element als

                                anzugeben, da es Informationen enthält, die nicht Teil des

                                where a full representation of a text requires the alternative

                                containing structural subdivisions, and for those containing
                                overlapping additions and deletions.</p>
                            <p>The text deleted must be at least partially legible in order for the
                                encoder to be able to transcribe it (unless it is restored in a
                                <gi>supplied</gi> tag). Illegible or lost text within a deletion may
                                be marked using the <gi>gap</gi> tag to signal that text is present
                                but has not been transcribed, or is no longer visible. Attributes on
                                the <gi>gap</gi> element may be used to indicate how much text is
                                omitted, the reason for omitting it, etc. If text is not fully
                                legible, the <gi>unclear</gi> element (available when using the
                                additional tagset for transcription of primary sources) should be
                                used to signal the areas of text which cannot be read with
                                confidence in a similar way.</p>

                                deletion was intended may be indicated by use of the

                            <p>There is a clear distinction in the TEI between <gi>del</gi> and

                                <gi>unclear</gi> on the other. <gi>del</gi> indicates a deletion
                                present in the source being transcribed, which states the author's
                                or a later scribe's intent to cancel or remove text.
                                <gi>surplus</gi> indicates material present in the source being
                                transcribed which should have been so deleted, but which is not in
                                fact. <gi>gap</gi> or <gi>unclear</gi>, by contrast, signal an
                                editor's or encoder's decision to omit something or their inability
                                to read the source text. See sections <ref

                            <p>Die TEI unterscheidet eindeutig zwischen <gi>del</gi> und

                                auf der anderen Seite. <gi>del</gi> beschreibt eine Löschung in der
                                zu transkribierenden Ressource, die darauf hinweist, dass ein Autor
                                oder späterer Schreiber bewusst Text löschen oder entfernen wollte.
                                Das <gi>surplus</gi>-Element beschreibt Text in der zu
                                transkribierenden Ressource, der gelöscht werden sollte, aber in
                                Wirklichkeit nicht gelöscht wurde. Die Elemente <gi>gap</gi> oder
                                <gi>unclear</gi> hingegen beschreiben eine vom Editor oder
                                Auszeichnenden getroffene Entscheidung, etwas auszulassen oder deren
                                Unvermögen, die Textvorlage zu entziffern. Vergleiche die Abschnitte

                                            Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001-2010, aged 2 to 11
                                            years were analyzed. Child-level food insecurity was
                                            assessed with the US Department of Agriculture's Food
                                            Security Survey Module based on eight child-specific
                                            questions. Personal food insecurity was assessed with
                                            five additional questions. Obesity was defined, using
                                            physical measurements, as body mass index (calculated as
                                            kg/m2) greater than or equal to the age- and
                                            sex-specific 95th percentile of the Centers for Disease
                                            Control and Prevention growth charts. Logistic
                                            regressions adjusted for sex, race/ethnic group, poverty
                                            level, and survey year were conducted to describe
                                            associations between obesity and food insecurity.</p>

                                        <p>Obesity was significantly associated with personal food
                                            insecurity for children aged 6 to 11 years (odds
                                            ratio=1.81; 95% CI 1.33 to 2.48), but not in children
                                            aged 2 to 5 years (odds ratio=0.88; 95% CI 0.51 to
                                            1.51). Child-level food insecurity was not associated
                                            with obesity among 2- to 5-year-olds or 6- to
                                            11-year-olds.</p>

                                        <p>Personal food insecurity is associated with an increased
                                            risk of obesity only in children aged 6 to 11 years.
                                            Personal food-insecurity measures may give different
                                            results than aggregate food-insecurity measures in
                                            children.</p>

                            <p>Where running heads are consistent throughout a chapter or section,
                                it is usually more convenient to relate them to the chapter or
                                section, e.g. by use of the <att>rend</att> attribute. The
                                <gi>fw</gi> element is intended for cases where the running head
                                changes from page to page, or where details of page layout and the
                                internal structure of the running heads are of paramount

                                indicates the number or other value associated with the text between
                                this point and the next <gi>lb</gi> element, typically the sequence
                                number of the line within the page, or other appropriate unit. This
                                element is intended to be used for marking actual line breaks on a
                                manuscript or printed page, at the point where they occur; it should
                                not be used to tag structural units such as lines of verse (for
                                which the <gi>l</gi> element is available) except in circumstances
                                where structural units cannot otherwise be marked. </p>
                            <p>The <att>type</att> attribute may be used to characterize the line

                                break is word-breaking, or to note the source from which it derives.

                                <item>我們領悟：愉快的共同生活，全靠心靈溝通，所以，我們一定善用言語，不僅表達愛心、關心，也使彼此藉語言加深了解，一起成長。絕不粗聲叱責，絕不用肢體代替言語，絕不允許發生婚姻暴力。 </item>

                                    <p>In modern texts, notes are usually anchored by means of
                                        explicit footnote or endnote symbols. An explicit indication
                                        of the phrase or line annotated may however be used instead
                                        (e.g. <q>page 218, lines 3–4</q>). The <att>anchored</att>
                                        attribute indicates whether any explicit location is given,
                                        whether by symbol or by prose cross-reference. The value
                                        <val>true</val> indicates that such an explicit location is
                                        indicated in the copy text; the value <val>false</val>
                                        indicates that the copy text does not indicate a specific
                                        place of attachment for the note. If the specific symbols
                                        used in the copy text at the location the note is anchored
                                        are to be recorded, use the <att>n</att> attribute.</p>

                                        place, une indication explicite de l'expression ou de la
                                        ligne annotée peut cependant être employée (par exemple
                                        <q>page 218, lignes 3–4</q>). L'attribut <att>anchored</att>

                                    really was not asking for help, only to borrow the axe. Hope you
                                    had fun in any case.</p>

                                    <p>The level of a title is sometimes implied by its context: for
                                        example, a title appearing directly within an
                                        <gi>analytic</gi> element is <foreign>ipso facto</foreign>

                                        <gi>series</gi> element of level <q>s</q>. For this reason,
                                        the <att>level</att> attribute is not required in contexts
                                        where its value can be unambiguously inferred. Where it is

                    <p>The following elements are modified by the TEI simplePrint specification,
                        mostly by the addition of a processing model, but in other cases by
                        additional constraints on the attributes they may have, or the values those
                        attributes may take. Additional examples are also provided for some of them. </p>
