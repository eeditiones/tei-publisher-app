                        <note>He was born Karl Goldschmidt in Germany, in 1912. He trained as a graphic artist
            but left his native country in 1933 on Hitler's rise to power. 
            1934 found him in Dey, Majorca, where the poets Robert Graves and Laura Riding
            befriended the intelligent young man. He learnt English (reading Defoe) and was
            soon helping with their Seizin Press and their typing, and wrote amusingly in Focus, their magazine.
            At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, all three left Majorca on a Royal Navy destroyer.
            Graves persuaded the ship's captain not to transfer Goldschmidt to a German ship, and back to Germany,
            conscious of the fate that would, as a Jew, await him.
            In England Goldschmidt obtained leave to stay and work and, when the Second World War broke out,
            he gallantly served first in the Pioneer Corps, and later in the Royal Navy.
            In the Pioneers - as a protection in case of capture - he had been made to change his name.
            He became known (though he was always called Karl by his friends) as Kenneth Gay.
            When the war was over, he was granted full British citizenship.</note>

                        <note>Deià is a small coastal village in the Serra de Tramuntana, which forms the northern
      ridge of the Spanish island of Mallorca. It is located about ten miles north of
      Valldemossa, and it is known for its literary and musical residents. Its idyllic landscape,
      orange and olive groves on steep cliffs overlooking the Mediterranean, served as a draw for
      German, English, and American expatriates after the First World War.</note>

            <p> Good luck in your interview. If you are wholly at your ease - and why not? - all
               will go well. But try to raise some sort of enthusiasm for your proposed career:
               dont-care-ism doesn't go down well. </p>
            <p> There's never been so wet a <date>November</date> since - since last time - but we
               have had about three sunny days, and I even bathed three days ago at <name type="place" ref="#CanFloque">Can Floque</name>. The best news is getting 3
               bottles of butagaz smuggled from <name type="place" ref="#France">France</name>,
               which means no more dirty carbon in the kitchen until the supply gives out. </p>
            <p> We hope to spend a few days in <name type="place" ref="#Austria">Austria</name> with
                  <name type="person" ref="#NicholsonJenny">Jenny</name> on the way to <name type="place" ref="#Yugoslavia">Jugland</name>, but she is all snarled up with the
                  <name type="person" ref="#BevanAneurin">Bevan</name> libel case (on November 21st)
               &amp; doesn't answer letters. She was very nice to <name type="person" ref="#GravesLucia">Lucia</name> and <name type="person" ref="#GravesJuan">Juan</name> on the way through. </p>

               life not dream) crippled with a slipped disk and in agony, &amp; the doctor kept
               ineffectually injecting her with anaesthetics. In the dream a woman said: "I have a
               wonderful recipe for you downstairs, come and try it!" She crawled out of bed, fell
               downstairs, &amp; somehow in her fall slipped the disk back. Now she's as right as
               rain. <name type="person" ref="#ReidAlastair">Alastair</name>'s address is: <name type="place" ref="#BellRockHouse">Bell Rock
