      <title>What TEI Publisher does ...</title>
      <para> The motivation behind TEI Publisher was to provide a tool which enables scholars and
        editors to publish their materials without becoming programmers, but also does not force
        them into a one-size-fits-all framework. Experienced developers will benefit as well by
        writing less code, avoiding redundancy, improve maintenance and interoperability - to just
        name a few. TEI Publisher is all about <emphasis role="bold">standards</emphasis>, <emphasis
          role="bold">modularity</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">reusability</emphasis> and
          <emphasis role="bold">sustainability</emphasis>! </para>
      <para>In Publisher, it all starts with your source documents - regardless if they are in TEI
        or other form of XML: DocBook, MS Word (DOCX) or JATS. No matter how the source material has
        been encoded, it can be easily transformed into a range of output formats for publication -
        from a modern web page that you can open on your laptop or mobile device, to an ebook, a PDF
        file or its LaTeX source.</para>
      <para> TEI Publisher derives its name from TEI and the TEI Processing Model (PM). Processing
        Model is a part of the TEI vocabulary and TEI ODD specification format, described in the
          <link xlink:show="new"
          xlink:href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html#TDPM">TEI P5
          guidelines</link> as well as further chapters here. It defines how a TEI document should
        be rendered in different output formats and lies at the heart of TEI Publisher. </para>
      <para>However, online editions require more than just a text transformation: the text needs to
        be embedded into an application context, adding navigation, pagination, search, facsimile
        display and so on. The larger part of TEI Publisher deals with those aspects, providing all
        the necessary building blocks for an online edition.</para>
      <para> Staying true to the spirit of code reuse and interoperability, TEI Publisher implements
        its functionalities as small "lego" blocks to be freely arranged and recombined. The
        technology making this possible is called <emphasis>Web Components</emphasis>. It is part of
        the HTML5 specification and natively implemented by many browsers. Users don't need to dive
        into the details of this standard though: all you need to modify the example pages is some
        basic HTML knowledge. </para>
      <para> Only where the <link xlink:show="new"
          xlink:href="https://cdn.tei-publisher.com/api.html">available components</link> are not
        enough, a new use case needs to be described and suitable new components implemented but
        then they can be incorporated into existing component pool for everyone else to use. After
        all, our mantra is reuse, reuse, reuse and we want to turn TEI Publisher into a box of tools
        the entire community can benefit from. </para>
      <para>Despite the elegant simplicity of this approach, various projects we realized in the
        past prove that TEI Publisher is:</para>

      <para> Since its first incarnation in 2015, TEI Publisher has gained substantial following
        with numerous academic and commercial projects around the globe using it for their editorial
        and publishing needs. Grass-roots user initiative led in 2020 to the foundation of an
        international non-profit association <link xlink:show="new"
          xlink:href="https://e-editiones.org">e-editiones.org</link> with the focus on further
        joint development of TEI Publisher, open standards and best practices for digital editions. </para>

      <para>TEI Publisher development is only possible thanks to generous contributions of
        developers, users and institutions willing to employ Open Source approaches so that the
        whole community can reuse and benefit from their work.</para>

      <para> A growing number of projects from small to large that have decided to publish their
        materials with TEI Publisher gives us all not only the opportunity but also the
        responsibility to make the project thrive for years to come and to make it truly sustainable
        option for XML publishing! Consider joining <link xlink:show="new"

      <title>Versions</title>
      <para>TEI Publisher has been under active development since 2015. Once or twice a year a new
        major version is released, bringing important new features.</para>
      <para>Minor versions are released at shorter intervals and offer bug fixes, minor new features
        and improvements.</para>
      <para>The current major version of the TEI Publisher is 8.0.0</para>

      <para> There's a long list of ideas and features we'd like to see incorporated into TEI
        Publisher: from wider coverage of input and output formats (e.g. InDesign), CQL and DTS
        support, to various editing workflows and support for efficient hosting and maintenance of
        multiple editions. These ideas are in various stages of development - some already advanced,
        some in conceptual phase, some waiting for funding and implementation. Coordination of
        future work is primarily conducted by <link xlink:show="new"

      <section xml:id="v8">
        <title>What's new in TEI Publisher 8.0.0</title>
        <para>Version 8 has been focused on a major rework of the URL handling and redesign of
          search facilities. A number of further examples gives a better idea of the projects
          already using TEI Publisher for their editions. There have also been significant changes
          to connected resources: the tei-publisher-lib, webcomponents library and roaster.</para>
        <para>See chapter on <link linkend="updating">Updating</link> for information how to update
          your app to the newest version.</para>

      <section xml:id="v7">
        <title>What's new in TEI Publisher 7.0.0</title>
        <para>Version 7 brought another major refactoring and restructuring of TEI Publisher app,
          particularly regarding the server-side modules.</para>
        <para> TEI Publisher now exposes a well-defined, clear <link xlink:href="../api.html"
            xlink:show="new">API specification</link> following the <link xlink:show="new"
            xlink:href="http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3">Open API standard</link>. This API is
          used in TEI Publisher by client-side UI components but can be equally well utilized by
          independent software which harnesses functionality exposed via the API without being
          forced to rely on Publisher's client-side components. </para>
        <para> On the server a new package, <filename>oas-router</filename>, reads the API
          specification and uses it to map HTTP requests to XQuery functions which perform actual
          API operations. Other packages, particularly UI web components (
            <filename>pb-components</filename>) and TEI Processing Model library (
            <filename>tei-publisher-lib</filename>) underwent necessary changes to communicate with
          the new API as well as retain full backwards compatibility. </para>

        <para>Beyond the structural changes a number of reported issues has been fixed and broader
          test coverage for all packages introduced. A sophisticated CI setup based on Docker has
          been created. Extensive test suite has been prepared for individual components.
          Furthermore, every API operation is independently tested against the specification, to
          assure that e.g. parameter and response types correspond exactly to the definition.</para>

        <para> Thanks to community contributions via <link xlink:show="new"
            xlink:href="https://crwd.in/tei-publisher">Crowdin</link>, TEI Publisher is now
          available in 20 languages. </para>

        <para> See chapter on <link linkend="updating">Updating</link> for information how to update
          your app to take advantage of these developments. </para>

        <title>What's new in TEI Publisher 6.0.0</title>
        <para>Version 6 brought a major refactoring and restructuring of TEI Publisher app libraries
          along with new specialized components and use case examples.</para>

                xlink:href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/">LitElement</link> and to the
              npm library </para>
            <para>While invisible to users, this redesign greatly improves the modularity of
              Publisher-based applications. With Publisher web component releases published on npm,
              updating the user interface for all Publisher-based apps is just a question of
              changing a single variable in the configuration file.</para>
            <para> Furthermore, Publisher's library of web components - true to the basic idea of
                <link xlink:show="new"
                xlink:href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web
                Components Standard</link> can be included in any HTML webpage e.g. can be embedded
              into existing CMS or any other publishing solution, even if it's not running eXist-db. </para>
            <para> Similarly, if you prefer to write your own application using any of the popular
              frameworks like <emphasis>angular, vue or react</emphasis> you can easily import the
                <code> pb-components</code> package from npm and use it directly in your project. </para>
            <para>As a final consequence, this change decouples the component library from the TEI
              Publisher app. It is now possible to host multiple applications, which depend on
              different versions of the component library, without conflict within the same eXist-db
              instance, a point of importance for institutions with numerous projects.</para>

            <para> Encapsulation of styles offered by web components can be a mixed blessing and

              While some aspects of component styling remained unaccessible for customization in
              previous versions, Publisher 6 exposes majority of styling properties via standard CSS
              files and theme variables. Stylesheets can also be specified within the ODD, as
              previously, or through <code>pb-view</code> component configuration attributes.

        <para> If you do not want to install eXist yourself, you can use docker to run TEI

          creates a virtual environment including everything required for the service to run. Using
          our <link xlink:show="new"
            xlink:href="https://hub.docker.com/r/existdb/teipublisher"
            >docker image</link>, eXist will already be set up to include TEI Publisher as well as

    <section xml:id="odd-experiments">
      <title>Experimenting with ODDs and page templates</title>
      <para> All TEI Publisher's sample documents are XML files which are transformed into a
        HTML webpage for display in the browser. Two major factors determine how the final page is
        going to look like: an <emphasis role="bold">ODD</emphasis> and a <emphasis role="bold">page
          template</emphasis>. </para>

      <para> We have already mentioned in the very first section that the TEI Processing Model lies
        at the heart of the Publisher - the ODD file associated with a document defines the rules of
        transformation of the XML source file into HTML. Detailed discussion of the Processing Model
        can be found in <link linkend="pm-syntax">following chapters</link>, for now it is
        sufficient to say this is where decisions if a TEI element should be rendered inline, with a
        tooltip, or as a marginal note, are made. Simplifying things a bit the
          <emphasis>text</emphasis> of the document that you see rendered in your browser is an
        effect of applying the rules from ODD file to the source document. </para>
      <para> Nevertheless, as we demonstrated in the section on selected sample documents, in the
        application context we certainly want more than just text, however nicely typeset. From
        basic navigation controls, table of content, to facsimile display, critical apparatus,
        glossaries and maps - all of this and much more could be included in the final webpage.
        Following <emphasis>divide and conquer</emphasis> approach the TEI Publisher defines such
        specialized page elements as small, reusable blocks, using the Web Components technology.
        Components can be used like common HTML elements, thus a page template is just an HTML
        fragment which organizes the building blocks needed for a specific page. </para>
      <para> Looking more closely again at the TEI Publisher's <guibutton>Start</guibutton> page, we
        can now give more detail what is happening when any of the sample documents is loaded. On
        the right hand side there is a panel listing all ODD files available. Each of the sample
        documents includes a processing instruction which specifies default ODD and page template
        for this document. You can check what they are in <guibutton>Settings</guibutton> panel. For
        the Graves letter it would be <parameter>Graves' Letters</parameter> ODD and
          <parameter>Letter with map/facets</parameter> template. </para>
      <figure>
        <title>The Settings Panel for the Graves Letter</title>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para> It is easy to experiment with different page templates and ODDs just changing these
        options in the <guibutton>Settings</guibutton> panel. An important caveat though is that not
        every page template makes sense for every document - after all parallel alignment can only
        be successful if there is something to align, map needs coordinates to display, page view
        needs information about page breaks and so on. </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="upload">
      <title>Uploading your own documents</title>
      <para> If you read this, in all likelihood you already have some documents of your own you
        might want published, whether they are in TEI, DocBook, JATS, MS Word DOCX or other XML format.
        The first step is to upload them into the database. You need to be <emphasis role="bold"
          >logged in</emphasis> and in the Playground area to do it (check the short info on the
          <guibutton> Start</guibutton> page for user name and password).</para>
      <para>TEI Publisher installs two default application users:</para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>tei-demo (default password: <emphasis>demo</emphasis>)</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>This user can upload to the playground, annotations and jats collections. It can create new ODDs and
              edit them. However, it cannot recompile ODDs other than the ones it created.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>tei (default password: <emphasis>simple</emphasis></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>has full access to all collections, can change all ODDs, generate apps etc. On a public server we
              strongly recommend to change at least this user's password.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      <para>Upon successful login, uploading is just a
        question of dragging your documents onto the <guibutton>Upload</guibutton> area. They will
        become available in the document list immediately after upload is completed. </para>

      </figure>
      <para> Congratulations, now you can view your documents! Try to experiment and find the ODD
        and page template that best fits your needs and use it as a starting point for your own
        customization, if necessary. Once you are ready with these you can <link
          linkend="create-app">generate your own application</link> for your documents only, which
        packs just what is needed for publishing into a standalone application package. </para>
      <para> If you attempt to upload a Microsoft Word document, the upload will automatically
        trigger upconversion of Word to TEI, using a custom ODD for the tranformation. Please note
        that the focus of this conversion is to preserve textual content, structure and basic
        semantics of the text, not provide authoritative mapping of complete set of MS Word features
        to TEI. Refer to <link linkend="docx">DOCX handling</link> section for more information. </para>
      <note>
        <title>Note</title>
        <para>Please bear in mind that while TEI Publisher aims to be a universal tool, the specific
          components may make certain assumptions about data they are getting and if your documents
          do not follow the same conventions it may be required to adjust parameters passed to the
          components from the page template or the component logic.</para>
        <para> By means of example - a table of content component assumes that the document
          structure is represented by means of nested <parameter>div</parameter> elements and
          section titles are given in <parameter>head</parameter> element. If your project rather
          chooses numbered divisions (<parameter>div1</parameter>, <parameter>div2</parameter>) etc
          it may be advisable to adjust this to avoid customizing all navigation, table of contents
          and so on, but it is one of very rare cases where TEI Publisher exposes any predilection
          for a particular flavour of TEI. </para>
        <para> Similarly, the template for aligned transcription and translation is parametrized to
          accept an XPath expression pointing to the location of the transcription and aligned
          translation. Likely for your documents this expression would have to be adjusted (unless
          of course you also have Latin texts with Polish translation structured in a similar way).
          Furthermore, to correctly display corresponding translation fragment a custom mapping
          function may need to be passed to the translation view (cf. <link
            xlink:href="templates/pages/vangogh.html" role="source">
            <filename>Van Gogh</filename>

      <para>In principle, any TEI document will be supported by TEI Publisher and can be displayed

      <para>Nevertheless, certain assumptions are made about encoding of the basic structure of the

          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>We acknowledge that TEI offers other ways to encode these features, e.g. generic
          <tag>milestone</tag> element or specialized numbered division elements like
          <tag>div1</tag>, <tag>div2</tag>. TEI documents using alternative encodings will be still
        displayed as specified in the ODD, it is only for the sake of navigation or division-based
        full text search that we had to assume certain conventions to be able to decide what to show
        as the next page, column or division. </para>
      <para> We believe our choice represents most common way of using TEI but, for those who

      <title>MS Word DOCX format conversion</title>
      <para> Starting with the version 5.0.0 of the TEI Publisher a new docx handling module is
        available to allow for ingesting documents in <emphasis>docx</emphasis> format. Goal of this
        module is to provide a way to import Word documents, preserving their textual content,
        structure and basic semantics of the text, not to provide an authoritative mapping of
        complete set of MS Word features to TEI. </para>
      <para>Docx format is relatively flat, thus reconstructing logical document structure like
        divisions, lists and similar can be only based on certain heuristics. Likewise it is
        impossible to deduce semantics attributed to certain formatting decisions. For that reason
        TEI Publisher by intention ignores many style properties — trying to preserve as much as
        possible would likely just add unnecessary "noise" and result in low-quality TEI. </para>


      <section xml:id="docx-intro">
        <title>A word about Word</title>

        <para> A Word document is essentially a zip archive of several different XML files. These

          Information most relevant for the import process have been extracted into a map, which is
          passed as a parameter to the ODD, so it is available for every element. Thus information
          about numbering styles can be accessed via <code>$parameters?nstyle(.)</code> function and
          testing if a list is bulleted could be done checking the value of <code>

                Styles whose name starts with <code>tei:</code> are thus recognized as TEI elements

                  Goethe&lt;/persName&gt;</code>. A place name should be marked with a style <code>

                element. The outline level assigned to the heading is recorded as well. </para>
              <para> Subsequently, in a second pass through the generated output, divisions are
                generated based on the outline level: a <tag>div</tag> spans all text from the
                heading to the next heading on the same outline level and the process is repeated

    <title>Processing Model transformations</title>
    <para>While TEI Publisher already provides various ODDs and page templates targeting specific
      domains, it is likely that your project may require certain adjustments to fully meet your
      needs. It has been one of primary concerns in Publisher's design that customization is not
      only possible on various levels but also encouraged and we aim it to be as simple as
      possible.</para>
    <para> Very broadly we can group customization needs into two sets: changing the rules for
      document transformation (how the source document is translated into the output format) or
      changing the organization and styling of the rendered web page. In this chapter we'll
      concentrate on the former, document transformation, which primarily requires modification of
      the ODD with the <link linkend="pm-syntax">TEI Processing Model</link>. The latter would
      require <link linkend="customizing-page-template">adjustments of the page template</link>. In
      both cases, it may be best to choose as your starting point an already existing ODD or page
      template and adjust it. </para>

      <section xml:id="odd-customization-first-odd">

        </para>
        <para> For the purpose of this quickstart, we will reuse one of the pre-installed sample
          documents, but create a new ODD for it.</para>
        <procedure>
          <step>
            <para> Log in and fill out the form at the bottom of the panel listing ODD files. Choose
              a name for the ODD, e.g. <option>myletter</option> (without a suffix) and a title,
              which will appear in the list after creation. Click on <guibutton>Create</guibutton>
              button.</para>
            <para>The newly created ODD should appear in the side panel.</para>
          </step>
          <step>
            <para> In the document list, click on <emphasis>Letter #6 from Robert Graves to William
                Graves</emphasis> to open it in the document viewer. </para>
          </step>
          <step>
            <para> Open the <guibutton>Settings</guibutton> panel (rightmost toolbar button, see
              above) and choose your ODD from the dropdown showing available ODDs. You may also
              change the used HTML template to <option>Default single text layout</option>, though
              this is not absolutely necessary. </para>
          </step>
          <step>
            <para> The view should change and display the letter's content with only basic
              formatting applied. Since our ODD has just been created and is empty, we see the
              content with standard formatting applied. Our ODD by default inherits from <filename>
                teipublisher.odd</filename>. The latter is maintained by the e-editiones community
              and contains processing model declarations for the most common TEI elements. Thanks
              to this inheritance mechanism, many documents display nicely without requiring a lot
              of additional customization. </para>
          </step>
          <step>
            <para> From the menu, select <guimenu>Admin</guimenu> / <guimenuitem>Edit
                ODD</guimenuitem> to open the visual ODD editor. </para>

      <section xml:id="modify-odd">
        <title>Modify the ODD</title>
        <para> Changing processing models in the ODD is a powerful mechanism through which you can
          control all aspects of the transformation of your documents from source XML format to all
          output formats: HTML, ePUB, PDF etc. As already mentioned it is considered best practice
          to chain ODD customizations together and rather change or add project specific rules to
          more generic ODD than copy them in extenso. ODD chaining allows for the future upgrades as
          your base ODDs may be updated by standardization bodies which maintain them. Commonly
          project ODDs would extend <filename>teipublisher.odd</filename>, a generic TEI Publisher
          set of processing rules. </para>
        <para>Beginning with version 3.0 of TEI Publisher, you have the choice between writing the
          ODD by hand or using a visual editor. Both approaches can be combined and mixed. The
          visual editor saves the ODD in a non-destructive way, preserving any information not
          related to the processing model. It is thus safe to switch between hand-editing the ODD
          and using the visual editor. Just make sure you reload the visual editor view after
          modifying the source XML and vice versa. That said, visual editor is specifically tailored
          to editing processing models so it will be likely the fastest and safest way to edit your
          ODD.</para>
        <para>To be able to customize the display of your document it is crucial to understand its
          XML structure well. Each of processing models needs to be aimed at a particular XML
          element and sometimes is only meant for a specific XML context - let's say we might want
          to distinguish between headings of first and second level of nested divisions as they
          often represent titles of different text units: acts and scenes or books and
          chapters.</para>
        <para>We'll start with the Graves' letter you have already viewed applying your custom ODD
          in previous section. The display is quite simple and easy to read but we might want to
          adjust it to follow common visual conventions for a letter, starting with displaying the
          dateline on the right hand side and completely removing the page label which currently
          sits there.</para>
        <para> To create a processing model addressing this need we have to know 3 things: </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              <emphasis role="bold">when</emphasis> should it be applied, </para>

          <listitem>
            <para> and <emphasis role="bold">how</emphasis> should the text be formatted? </para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para> To be able to answer the first question, you should familiarize yourself with the XML
          structure of the letter to find out how datelines are represented in TEI. In the tab
          displaying the letter, select <guimenuitem>Download</guimenuitem> / <guimenuitem>XML
          </guimenuitem> to open <link xlink:href="data/test/graves6.xml" role="source">
            <filename>graves6.xml</filename>
          </link> in eXide. Quick investigation of the TEI encoding will reveal that dateline
          resides in its eponymic tag <tag>dateline</tag> wchich is nested in the <tag>opener</tag>
          part of the document, while page labels are encoded with <tag>pb</tag>. </para>
        <para> We'll use the visual editor, but show the corresponding ODD XML below each
          screenshot. At the end of this chapter we'll describe how to edit the ODD XML code <link

        <para> The visual ODD editor opens if you select <guimenuitem>Admin</guimenuitem> /

          Alternatively you can click on the name of an ODD in the list of ODDs on the TEI Publisher
          entry page. A new tab opens, showing an action panel to the left, and the title of your

          insert a processing model rule for <tag> dateline</tag> into the right panel. Because
            <tag>dateline</tag> already exist in the base ODD,
          <filename>teipublisher.odd</filename>, you'll see a single model which was copied from the
          base ODD. </para>

        <para>The corresponding ODD XML looks like this:</para>
        <programlisting language="xml" xml:space="preserve">&lt;elementSpec mode="change" ident="dateline"&gt;
    &lt;model behaviour="block"/&gt;
&lt;/elementSpec&gt;</programlisting>
        <para> Let's cover some key concepts of the TEI processing model first:
            <tag>elementSpec</tag> primarily documents the structure, content, and purpose of an
          element. It is a core element in any ODD but the schema-related functions are not relevant
          for the discussion here. What is important for us is this is where processing models are
          defined. The <parameter> @ident</parameter> attribute of the <tag>elementSpec</tag>
          identifies the name of the element to which the spec (and therefore processing model)
          applies. </para>
        <para> An <tag>elementSpec</tag> may contain one or more <tag>model</tag> elements to
          specify the intended processing of this element. Every model maps the element to a
            <option> behaviour</option>. A behaviour denotes an abstract transformation function to
          be applied. The TEI guidelines currently list two dozen behaviours, e.g. paragraph,
          heading, note, inline, block. The last two are the most frequently used. How exactly a
          behaviour translates into the target output media may differ depending on media features
          and design decisions. TEI Publisher tries to implement them as generically as possible. </para>
        <para> To change the model expand it by clicking on the arrow to the left of the grey box. A
          form appears, allowing you to change the model configuration. In our example we are happy
          with <emphasis>what</emphasis> is happening with the dateline, so we don't need to change
          the behaviour but we do want to fix <emphasis>how</emphasis> it is styled by justifying it
          to the right. Rendition can be defined in an <tag>outputRendition</tag>, so click on the
            <guibutton> +</guibutton> button next to <guibutton>Renditions</guibutton>. In the form
          input being inserted below, enter your styling requirements in css. </para>
        <para> The processing model uses <tag>outputRendition</tag> and CSS to define visual
          aspects. For output formats other than XML, the CSS is translated into the corresponding
          target language. It is thus best to limit the CSS to the most common typographical
          features, like bold, italic, color, underline etc. The general styling of the text should
          be done outside the ODD to maintain a clear separation of concerns. </para>

          <title> Add a rendition for <tag>dateline</tag>

        <para>Again here's the corresponding XML:</para>

  &lt;model behaviour="block"&gt;
      &lt;outputRendition&gt;text-align: right;&lt;/outputRendition&gt;
  &lt;/model&gt;
&lt;/elementSpec&gt;</programlisting>
        <para> To test your change, click on <guibutton>Save</guibutton> in the left panel and wait
          a second until a popup appears. Switch back to the tab with Graves' letter from which you
          opened the editor and refresh the browser window to see your changes applied. In case you
          do not see any change, make sure </para>

            <para> if you made changes to outputRenditions only, you may need to clear your

        <para> This rule affects places and people alike since both these categories are marked up
          with <tag>name</tag> tag. If we'd like to treat people and places differently we'd need
          separate models for them and a mechanism to distinguish between the two. The processing

          <para>The order of models within the element spec is important. If you move the model with
            the predicate to the bottom, all names will appear in the same color again. This happens
            because the processor walks through the models until it finds the first one matching the
            current node. If the model without predicate is first, it will always win over the one
            with the predicate!</para>
          <para>Also, if there's more than one matching model, only the first will be chosen.</para>

        <title>Parameters</title>
        <para> All behaviours accept one or more parameters which are defined in the TEI guidelines.
          Every behaviour has an implicit parameter called <parameter>content</parameter>, and, as
          the name suggests, it specifies which part of the source document should be processed: by
          default it uses the nested content of the node. You may overwrite this default and assign
          it another value. Some behaviours take other specialized parameters. For example, the
            <parameter> alternate</parameter> behaviour accepts two parameters:
            <parameter>default</parameter> and <parameter> alternate</parameter>. An alternate
          switches between two alternative states. On the web this could take the form of a popup,
          in print it is usually implemented as a footnote. </para>
        <para> To put this to a test, let's look at the <tag>date</tag> elements appearing within
          the letter. Most of them also specify a normalized date in their
            <parameter>@when</parameter> attribute. Seeing this may be helpful for the reader, for
          example, to know that the <parameter> 19th</parameter> mentioned in the postscript refers
          to <parameter>1957-12-19</parameter>. However, we may want to present the normalized date
          in a more readable way. XPath has a function <function>format-date</function> for the
          purpose and we could use it to show a representation of the date nicely formatted in the
          user's language. </para>
        <para> Add a new element spec for <tag>date</tag>. You'll already see 4 predefined models.
          The first two are for print only, but the third one does indeed use behaviour <function>
            alternate</function>, which is exactly what we want. Change the parameter value for
            <parameter> alternate</parameter> to format the date: </para>

      <title>Processing Model Syntax</title>
      <para>TEI gives users a lot of freedom: there's always more than one way to encode your
        material! To maintain interoperability and sustainability, you need a way to formally
        describe the schema used as well as document editorial guidelines and transcription
        processes. TEI ODD was designed for the purpose of expressing all this in the TEI language
        itself. But how a document should be rendered was previously still considered to be the
        responsibility of external publishing software and could not be described within the
        ODD.</para>
      <para> The advent of the TEI Processing Model changed this! The intended processing for all
        elements can now be expressed within the TEI vocabulary as part of the ODD thus fulfilling
        its promise of <emphasis role="bold">One Document Does It All</emphasis>. Markup elements
        are mapped to a small set of abstract transformation functions, called <emphasis role="bold"
          > behaviours</emphasis>. Basic styling features can be set directly within the ODD using
        CSS. The processing model is media-agnostic: behaviours and rendition styles are
        transparently translated into different output media types like HTML, XSL-FO, LaTeX, or
        ePUB. A single ODD can handle a multitude of output media types with just a few small
        adjustments. </para>

        <para>
          <tag>model</tag> element is primarily used to document the intended processing for a given
          element. One or more of these elements may appear directly within an
            <tag>elementSpec</tag> element specification to define the processing anticipated for
          that element. Where multiple <tag>model</tag> elements appear, they are understood to
          document mutually exclusive processing scenarios, possibly for different outputs or
          applicable in different contexts. </para>
        <para> A processing model defines on an abstract level how a given element may be
          transformed to produce one or more outputs. The model is expressed in terms of <emphasis
            role="bold">behaviours</emphasis> and their parameters, using high-level formatting
          concepts, such as <parameter>block</parameter>, <parameter>inline</parameter>, <parameter>
            note</parameter> or <parameter>heading</parameter>. A processing model is thus a
          template description, used to generate the code needed by the publishing application to
          process the source document into required output. </para>
        <para> The example below depicts a situation where a single model is defined for the
            <tag>app</tag> element. As no <parameter>@predicate</parameter> or
            <parameter>@output</parameter> are specified, this model applies for all contexts in
          which <tag>app</tag> may appear and all possible outputs. Thus all <tag>app</tag> elements
          will be transformed into inline chunks of text containing only contents of <tag>app</tag>

            indented block when it appears elsewhere. To achieve this, we need to change the

            as follows: </para>
          <programlisting language="xml" xml:space="preserve">&lt;elementSpec mode="change" ident="quote"&gt;

          <para> The first processing model will be used only for <tag>quote</tag> elements which

          <para> Behaviour functions accept a range of parameters, depending on the function in
            question. Where these parameters are left unspecified in the <tag>model</tag>, default
            values are used. All functions take at least one parameter:
              <parameter>content</parameter>. It will be added by default unless specified and
            contains the nested content of the currently processed node. You may change this by
            explicitely setting a <parameter> content</parameter> parameter inside the model. </para>
          <para> In the parameter lists below we skip the <parameter>content</parameter> parameter
            as it is available for every behaviour. Optional parameters are marked as <emphasis>
              optional</emphasis> in parenthesis, followed by the output mode they apply for, if
            relevant. </para>

      <title>Including General CSS Styles</title>
      <para> TEI Publisher is based on webcomponents, therefore styling of one document will not
        interfere with the styling of another document on the same page. All styles are strictly
        encapsulated within the component and do not "pollute" the global browser space. This also
        has a downside though: CSS rules defined outside the <tag>pb-view</tag> have no influence on
        the text styling inside the component (with some exceptions, mainly for properties which are
        inherited down the HTML tree, e.g. <parameter>font-family</parameter>). </para>
      <para> However, putting <emphasis>all</emphasis> styling information into
          <tag>outputRendition</tag> tags within the ODD is also not a good idea - it adds a lot of
        redundancy and mixes editorial responsibilities with web design concerns. </para>
      <para> The recommended solution would therefore be to use CSS classes for repeating styling
        aspects. TEI Publisher supports linking to an external CSS stylesheet from the <code>
          encodingDesc/tagsDecl/rendition</code> section of the ODD. Just specify a relative link in
        the <parameter>@source</parameter> attribute: </para>
      <programlisting language="xml" xml:space="preserve">
                  &lt;rendition source="docbook.css"/&gt;
          </programlisting>
      <para>The file should be stored in the same collection as the source ODD it is referenced
        from. The linked file should be a standard CSS stylesheet.</para>
      <para>Note that unfortunately, editing renditions is not yet supported by the visual ODD
        editor, so you will have to fall back to add the corresponding elements to the ODD by
        hand.</para>
      <para> Alternatively, one may also use the same TEI element <tag>rendition</tag> with the
          <parameter> @selector</parameter> attribute to embed CSS rules directly in the ODD. </para>

      <programlisting language="xml" xml:space="preserve">&lt;rendition selector="h3"&gt;
  font-family: serif;
  font-weight: 400;
&lt;/rendition&gt;</programlisting>
      <para>Choose one of the two approaches, but do not mix them. In both cases make sure to
        recompile the ODD after changes as the CSS is merged into the generated code!</para>

      <para>An addition introduced in Publisher 6.0 allows to pass the external CSS file in
          <code>load-css</code> attribute of <code>pb-view</code>. Recompiling ODD in this case is
        not necessary, otherwise it is functionally equivalent to using ODD <code>rendition</code>.

      <para>The quality of the generated output may vary a lot for the fo and latex modes, depending
        on the type of input document. The following section provides more details on the
        configuration of the FO output option:</para>
      <section xml:id="output-media-fo">
        <title>FO Output</title>
        <para>When generating XSL:FO output, the implementation tries to translate the CSS rules
          specified for renditions into the corresponding XSL:FO formatting properties. Not all CSS
          properties are recognized or can be mapped to FO properties. Unknown properties defined in
          a rendition will be ignored.</para>
        <para>The default rendering for headings, paragraphs and the like is defined by a separate
          CSS file. The implementation merges those defaults with the custom renditions given in the
          ODD.</para>
        <para> The library searches for default CSS styles in a file named <filename>
            &lt;odd-name&gt;.fo.css</filename> inside the specified output collection (in which the
          generated XQuery files are stored). The style definitions are copied literally into
          attributes on the output XSL:FO elements, so any property which is a valid attribute for
          the corresponding element may be used. For example,
            <filename>teipublisher.fo.css</filename> contains: </para>
        <programlisting language="css" xml:space="preserve">
.tei-text { font-family: "Junicode"; hyphenate: true; }
.tei-floatingText { padding: 6pt; }
.tei-p { text-align: justify; }
        </programlisting>
        <para>Every XSL:FO document needs a master layout and a page sequence definition. Because
          those tend to be rather verbose as they include things like page margins etc., they are
          read from two XML files:</para>
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>master.fo.xml</term>

          You may overwrite the defaults by providing your own template within the ODD element spec
          for the TEI root element. See the example ODDs mentioned above. Note that TEI Publisher
          will generate some LaTeX macros for styles defined in <tag>outputRendition</tag> which
          should be imported into the prolog. The styles are added to the default configuration map

          Select the print CSS download option for any of the documents in TEI Publisher which

          certain layout aspects. Thanks to this, using the <command>print page</command> dialog of

        <para>You can find a more detailed discussion of the feature along with some CSS examples in this <link xlink:href="https://www.e-editiones.org/posts/print-css/">article on the
          e-editiones homepage</link>.</para>
        <para>The preview page uses TEI Publisher's <code>pb-print-preview</code> web component.
          This component will retrieve the full HTML of the document, enhanced with additional CSS
          stylesheets for print, and passes it to paged.js for the page formatting. For testing
          purposes you can also click on the bottom-most button with the <guibutton>eye</guibutton>
          icon to see the raw HTML (without paged.js applied). This is handy if you want to inspect the HTML node
          hierarchy or the CSS classes assigned.</para>
        <para>To generate the HTML of the document, the component calls Publisher's API
          endpoint:</para>

        <para>As an open source project, paged.js does not support every fancy layout
          you may wish for. For example, support for formatting footnotes will be limited. There are
          other, mainly commercial tools, which you may use to generate PDF out of your HTML. Those
          include e.g. <link xlink:href="https://www.princexml.com/">Prince XML</link>, <link
            xlink:href="https://www.pdfreactor.com/">PDF Reactor</link> or <link

        <para>For command line tools, you can use the API endpoint described above to retrieve the

          endpoint URL (excluding the page.js components, which would interfere with external
          tools). The screenshot below shows princeXML's dialog into which you can paste the URL

        <title>XQuery Instead of XPath</title>
        <para>The implementation directly translates processing model instructions into an XQuery
          3.1 module by generating executable XQuery code. This is straightforward as the resulting
          XQuery will closely resemble the specification in the ODD, thus being easy to debug. It
          also leads to very efficient code, which is as fast or even faster as a hand-written,
          optimized transformation.</para>
        <para> As a welcome side effect, any valid XQuery expression might be used wherever the spec
          expects an XPath expression, e.g. in predicates or parameters. For example, one can define

        <title>Setting processing parameters for the ODD</title>

        <para>Depending on the application context we often wish to differentiate the desired

          edition we usually only want to see a rather short entry comprising of the author and
          title, but when viewing an individual document we certainly want to present all associated
          metadata, not to mention arrange that information visually in a distinct way. </para>
        <para>To this end, we can pass external parameters into the ODD, which inform the processor
          which of the processing scenarios we wish to follow.</para>

          the most common, use case for passing parameters in the ODD.</para>
        <para> In version 3.0.0 of the <code>tei-publisher-lib</code> we added two carefully chosen
          features to our implementation of the TEI Processing Model: </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>a method to specify a processing mode passed to all subsequently called

        <para> The first is implemented as a specialization of the second. Both features are
          intended for relatively rare cases, where the standard mechanisms for handling the flow of
          processing are not enough. This mainly applies to cases in which you have to process the
          same part of the TEI document multiple times in the same processing context (usually
            <code>pb-view</code>). None of the examples shipping with TEI Publisher needs these

          <para> The <tag>pb-view</tag> webcomponent also lets you define arbitrary parameters to be

          <title>Processing Modes </title>
          <para>Distinguishing between processing modes is a common feature in XSLT. It comes handy
            if you need to process the same XML more than once for different purposes. One common
            example would be to render a person reference once in the running text and again, as a
            footnote, but then perhaps together with the associated commentary but without
            information about textual features related to the process of writing, like scribal
            errrors in the spelling or gaps and stains on the parchment. As a rule of thumb, setting
            a mode is helpful where it would not be possible to distinguish the scenario to apply
            neither by the context in which the element appears in the XML source nor by the
            external parameter passed into the ODD. </para>
          <para>tei-publisher-lib 3 allows you to specify this new extension attribute,
              <code>@pb:mode</code>, on a <code>model</code>. The value of the attribute will be
            taken as the name of the mode, and subsequently called models can check it (e.g. in a
              <code>model</code>
            <emphasis>predicate</emphasis>) via this special variable, e.g.
              <code>$mode="register"</code> if your model definition specified this value, e.g.

          <para>The syntax is almost the same as for the standard <code>&lt;param name="foo"

            information from the publication statement part of the TEI file and only ends with a
            paragraph number. We could easily prepare the initial sequence on a division level and
            have it available to all nested paragraphs, thus saving the processing time required to
            look up from the paragraph to the TEI header every time. </para>

        <title>Code Templates and Custom Behaviours</title>
        <para>The two dozen behaviours defined by the TEI processing model are enough to cover most
          standard HTML output tasks like a listItem or heading, but more complex HTML markup or
          even other output formats like LaTeX require more customization and control over the
          generated output. The TEI Publisher library thus extends the processing model syntax with
          two custom elements for defining code templates.</para>
        <para>While TEI Publisher does provide ways to write your own behaviours in XQuery and thus
          extend the ones defined in the guidelines, this should only be used as last resort: custom
          XQuery behaviours limit the portability of the ODD and are bad for maintenance.</para>
        <para> Avoiding custom behaviours works quite well for HTML output and we have realized
          complex projects with just two or three extension behaviours. Things start to become more
          difficult if you try to output LaTeX though: there are hundreds of packages to use, and
          users typically define their own macros or environments for all recurring typesetting
          tasks. For example, to print a TEI <tag>persName</tag>, experienced LaTeX users would
          normally create a corresponding <code>\persName</code> macro and handle the formatting
          details there. Unfortunately, out of the box the TEI processing model does not facilitate
          this level of customization. </para>
        <section xml:id="pb-template">
          <title> Introducing <tag>pb:template</tag>
          </title>
          <para> TEI Publisher supports an extension to the ODD syntax in its own namespace (
              <parameter> http://teipublisher.com/1.0</parameter>). </para>
          <para> Within the ODD, a <tag>model</tag> may define a <tag>pb:template</tag> element
            containing a code template. The template is expanded first and the result is passed into
            the behaviour specified for the model, replacing the default
              <parameter>content</parameter> parameter accepted by all behaviours. The very simple
            case of outputting a <tag>persName</tag> in LaTeX could thus be written as: </para>

          <programlisting language="xml" xml:space="preserve">&lt;elementSpec ident="persName" mode="add"&gt;
    &lt;model behaviour="inline" output="latex"&gt;
        &lt;pb:template&gt;\persName{[[content]]}&lt;/pb:template&gt;
    &lt;/model&gt;
&lt;/elementSpec&gt;</programlisting>
          <para> The template can reference other parameters defined within the <tag>model</tag> by
            enclosing the parameter name in double brackets. In the example above we're referencing
            the default parameter <parameter>content</parameter>, which contains the nested content
            of the <tag>persName</tag> tag. The parameter will be processed before it is passed into
            the template, so if <tag>persName</tag> contains nested TEI markup, the corresponding
            processing model rules will be applied first. </para>
          <para> The result of expanding the template then becomes the new
              <parameter>content</parameter> parameter to be passed to the behaviour (
              <code>inline</code> in the example above), which is processed in the normal way as
            defined in the TEI guidelines. </para>
          <para> You may also specify additional parameters to be included in the template. For
            example, the TEI document may contain a glossary of terms which are referenced in the
            text using <code>&lt;term ref="#termid"&gt;text&lt;/term&gt;</code>. In LaTeX this would
            translate to <code>\glslink{ref}{text}</code>, which can be easily produced by the
            following <tag>model</tag> : </para>
          <programlisting language="xml" xml:space="preserve">&lt;elementSpec ident="term" mode="add"&gt;
    &lt;model behaviour="inline" output="latex"&gt;
        &lt;param name="ref" value="substring-after(@ref, '#')"/&gt;
        &lt;pb:template&gt;\glslink{[[ref]]}{[[content]]}&lt;/pb:template&gt;
    &lt;/model&gt;
&lt;/elementSpec&gt;</programlisting>
          <para> We define an additional parameter <parameter>ref</parameter>, which contains the id
            string from the <parameter>@ref</parameter> attribute, stripping out the leading '#'. </para>
          <para>The templating mechanism is not limited to LaTeX, but may also be used to generate
            HTML or FO, for example, if you have to generate a complex HTML fragment to represent a
            single TEI element. This is hard and sometimes impossible to achieve without
            templates</para>
          <para>This following sample uses the <parameter>pb-popover</parameter> webcomponent to

          <title>Defining New Behaviours in the ODD</title>
          <para>By combining code templates with parameters we can come up with a very simple
            mechanism to define new behaviours right inside the ODD!</para>
          <para> Take the TEI Publisher documentation as an example: it is written in Docbook 5 and
            transformed via ODD. The documentation includes some videos which are hosted on youtube.
            In DocBook these are represented by <tag>videodata</tag> elements inside a <tag>videoobject</tag>.</para>
          <programlisting xml:space="preserve">&lt;figure xml:id="edit-odd"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Screencast&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;mediaobject&gt;
      &lt;videoobject&gt;
        &lt;videodata fileref="https://www.youtube.com/embed/avRO-b2BwUI?rel=0" width="853" depth="480"/&gt;
      &lt;/videoobject&gt;
    &lt;/mediaobject&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</programlisting>
          <para> In the HTML output we would need to transform this into an <tag>iframe</tag>, so
            the reader can view the video embedded in the page. We can achieve this with a <tag>
              pb:template</tag> as sketched in the previous section, but it would be nice to turn
            this into a general-purpose behaviour, which we can re-use in other situations requiring
            an iframe. The TEI Publisher library allows us to define a behaviour right inside the
            ODD as follows: </para>

          <programlisting xml:space="preserve">&lt;pb:behaviour ident="iframe" output="web"&gt;
    &lt;pb:param name="src"/&gt;
    &lt;pb:param name="width"/&gt;
    &lt;pb:param name="height"/&gt;
    &lt;pb:template xmlns=""&gt;
        &lt;iframe src="[[src]]" width="[[width]]" height="[[height]]" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/pb:template&gt;
&lt;/pb:behaviour&gt;</programlisting>

          <note>
            <title>Note</title>
            <para> Note how we have to reset the namespace on the <tag>pb:template</tag> ? This is
              required because the default namespace in an ODD document is the TEI namespace. You
              therefore need to reset it whenever you want to output elements in another or no namespace
              inside a template. Without this, the iframe would end up in the TEI namespace.
              Web browsers will usually ignore it, but it would be incorrect nevertheless. </para>
          </note>
          <para> All behaviours should be included in the TEI header or - to be exact: the <tag>
              tagsDecl</tag> inside the <tag>encodingDesc</tag>. You may have multiple behaviour
            declarations with the same <parameter>@ident</parameter>, given that they apply to
            different <parameter>@output</parameter> modes. Parameters specified via
              <tag>pb:param</tag> without <parameter>@value</parameter> attribute are expected to be
            passed to the behaviour from the calling model. A parameter may be empty though. If you
            define an XPath expression as <parameter>@value</parameter> attribute, the result of the
            XPath evaluation will be used as value for the parameter. </para>
          <para> The new behaviour will be named <function>iframe</function> and takes three
            parameters: <parameter>src</parameter>, <parameter>width</parameter> and <parameter>
              height</parameter>. It can now be called from a <tag>model</tag> as follows: </para>
          <programlisting xml:space="preserve">&lt;model behaviour="iframe"&gt;
    &lt;param name="width" value="@width"/&gt;
    &lt;param name="height" value="@depth"/&gt;
    &lt;param name="src" value="@fileref"/&gt;
&lt;/model&gt;</programlisting>
          <para> For further code examples, please have a look at <link xlink:href="odd/docbook.odd"
              role="source">docbook.odd</link>, which is used for viewing the documentation. </para>

            <para> At the time of writing, the graphical ODD editor in TEI Publisher does not yet

              make these changes in the source XML using eXide, oXygen or another XML editor. You
              can, however, use the graphical editor to continue editing the ODD afterwards. It is

            to the empty sequence. You should not enforce a type or cardinality for any of the

      <title>Customizing web components styling</title>
      <para>A web component completely shields its content, so it cannot be styled from outside. Web
        component styles remain encapsulated, preventing style contamination between individual
        components and general application context. A blessing in general, allowing components to be
        scripted and styled without the fear of collision with other parts of the page, but poses
        additional challenges when adjusting the look and feel of a component to fit a project's
        theme.</para>
      <para> For Publisher, encapsulation of web components means that definitions in
          <code>theme.css</code> or equivalent project customization CSS files are not able to
        directly govern web components styling. </para>
      <para>Note that while you cannot directly change the inner appearance of a component, 
        you can style the component itself within the
        HTML template, e.g. to position it within the layout of the page.</para>

      <para>With TEI Publisher 8, or, more precisely, version 1.43.0 of the
          <code>tei-publisher-components</code>, a very robust method of applying styles throughout the page

        From Publisher version 6 <code>pb-components</code> certain style
        properties are exposed to the outside world via standard CSS variables. This way variables like 
        <code>--pb-footnote-color</code> defined in <code>theme.css</code> can be accessed by e.g.
        <code>pb-view</code> component and thus determine the color of the footnote marker in the

    <para> As described earlier, the various sample documents included in the TEI Publisher Demo

      composition of the page. They are based on different HTML templates, which can be found in the
        <filename> templates/pages</filename> collection of the TEI Publisher app. Each template
      assembles various building blocks in a slightly different way - some <link

      a parallel display of transcription andtranslation, some include a map and another showcase
      collapsible metadata section. Which template is being used is determined by a <link
        linkend="pi-config">processing instruction</link> in the TEI sources of these examples. </para>
    <para>The building blocks we mentioned are custom HTML elements. Each of them encapsulates a
      certain functionality and appearance. The map, the facsimile, but also the text view itself

      <title>Web Components</title>


      <para> The technology enabling this Lego-like modular approach is a W3C standard called

        improving quickly, reducing the need for external frameworks. There's a growing collection
        of ready-to-use components available, e.g. the <link xlink:show="new"
          xlink:href="https://www.webcomponents.org/author/PolymerElements">Polymer elements</link>
        we use for menus, buttons, dropdowns etc. TEI Publisher from version 6.0 exposes its

      <para>
        <tag>pb-page</tag>, <tag>pb-document</tag> and <tag>pb-view</tag> are three web components
        from <code>pb-components</code> library, while <tag>main</tag> is a standard HTML5 tag. The
        name of the custom element <emphasis role="bold">must</emphasis> start with a prefix to
        distinguish it from standard HTML. This concept should be familiar to XML people. For TEI
        Publisher components, the prefix is always <code>pb-</code>. Components from other sources
        will use different prefixes, e.g. <code>paper-</code> and <code>iron-</code> for the
          <emphasis> Polymer</emphasis> collection. </para>
      <para> The part of the page which uses TEI Publisher web components should always be wrapped
        into an <tag>pb-page</tag> element. This element determines the TEI Publisher server
        instance all other components will be communicating with (see the next section below). It is
        also responsible for some other initialization steps, e.g. loading the list of available
        user interface translations. . </para>
      <para>
        <tag>pb-document</tag> specifies a document source, which can then be referenced by id from
        other components. The component provides a way to configure basic properties governing
        document's default rendering, like associated ODD file, etc. In the example above, we define
        three properties for each document: </para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>path</term>
          <listitem>
            <para> the relative path to the XML document. This will be interpreted as relative to
              the <emphasis>data root collection</emphasis> of TEI Publisher, by default pointing to
              the <filename>data</filename> collection within the TEI Publisher app. </para>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>odd</term>
          <listitem>
            <para> the name - without suffix - of the ODD to use for rendering the document. In the
              example, the first document is encoded in TEI and thus transformed through <filename>
                dta.odd</filename>, while the second is written in DocBook and passed through
                <filename>docbook.odd</filename>. </para>

          <listitem>
            <para>this property determines how the document will be paginated if the user navigates
              forward/backward. Currently three possible methods are available:</para>

              <listitem>

                  <parameter>div</parameter> : displays one structural division (TEI div, DocBook

              <listitem>
                <para>
                  <parameter>page</parameter> : displays the document page by page. This requires
                  page break indicators to be present (<tag>pb</tag> in TEI, not supported for
                  docbook). </para>

              <listitem>
                <para>
                  <parameter>single</parameter> : the entire document (or a selected fragment of it)

      </variablelist>
      <para>
        <tag>pb-view</tag> is the critical component in TEI Publisher: it provides the actual text
        view by transforming a part or entirety of the source XML into HTML based on the processing
        model instructions in the ODD. </para>

      <para> Because webcomponents are all about encapsulation, <tag>pb-view</tag> ensures that the
        styling of the text as governed by the ODD will be confined to the boundaries of the
        component. This makes it possible to display two completely heterogenous texts (like the
        documentation and Kant's Kritik) on the same page without styles contaminating each other.
        As a downside, encapsulation also poses some challenges, which we discussed in the section
        about <link linkend="external-css">CSS styling</link>. </para>

    <section xml:id="webcomponents-communication">
      <title>Communication between Components</title>
      <para> To allow for maximum flexibility, nearly all of the TEI Publisher webcomponents
        communicate via events: this way avoids hard wiring and components may appear anywhere on
        the page. For example, the controls for paginating through a document do not directly talk
        to the document view: they just send an <emphasis>event</emphasis>, indicating the users'
        wish to navigate backward or forward. Components listening for this event may then react to
        it by refreshing the text being displayed. </para>
      <para> Since you can have multiple text views showing content from different sources, every
        event can be announced at a specific communication <emphasis>channel</emphasis>. This allows
        us to distinguish between different sources, e.g. two transcriptions being shown side by
        side. Most TEI Publisher components therefore accept two properties to configure the channel
        they are listening or sending events to: </para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>subscribe</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>name of the channel to which this component subscribes to. It will only react to
              events coming in via this channel.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>emit</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>name of the channel to which this components sends events.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      <para>If neither of these properties is given, the component will subscribe and emit to the
        global default channel. A component may also send to a different channel than it subscribes
        to, allowing chains of events.</para>

    <section xml:id="alignment">
      <title>Handling Complex Alignments</title>
      <para> It is often desirable to show two or more views of a document at the same time, for
        example to display the translation aligned with a given source fragment. In the simplest
        case, the transcription and translation may be aligned on the level of divisions or page
        breaks and one can simply use two <tag>pb-view</tag> referencing different starting points
        in the TEI document (this approach is implemented by the <link
          xlink:href="templates/pages/translation.html" role="source">translation.html</link>
        template for Serafin's letter). </para>
      <para>Unfortunately things are not always as simple as that. For example, even if the
        transcription contains page breaks or milestones which can be used to display a single page,
        the translation might not. One thus needs a different approach to compute the alignment
        between fragments. Nevertheless, the logic of the alignment algorithm will highly depend on
        the conventions used in the encoding. TEI allows a wide variety of alignment mechanisms and
        we do not want to limit the freedom of the editor by prescribing a particular method.</para>
      <para>TEI Publisher thus implements a generic way to plug an XQuery function into the
        processing pipeline. The function takes the source element being processed as input and may
        replace it by its aligned equivalent. Such an equivalent may be another element or fragment
        from the same or a different document. The source element will usually point to the part of
        the transcription being displayed. The mapping function uses this as starting point to
        determine an aligned fragment and returns it. The returned fragment will then be further
        passed through the processing model.</para>
      <para> The XQuery mapping function should be defined in the module
          <filename>modules/map.xql</filename>. It takes an element as its only argument and may
        return any valid TEI fragment, which will become the input for futher processing through the
        processing model. </para>
      <para> The local name of the mapping function can then be supplied in the attribute
          <parameter> map</parameter> of <tag>pb-view</tag>. As an illustration, the Van Gogh
        example includes the following <code>pb-view</code> for displaying the translation: </para>
      <programlisting language="xquery" xml:space="preserve">&lt;pb-view src="document1" map="vg-translation" xpath="//div[@type='original']"
    subscribe="transcription"/&gt;</programlisting>
      <para> In the Van Gogh letters, the translation contains page breaks corresponding to page
        breaks in the original letter, but these are using a different prefix for the
          <code>xml:id</code>. To align the translation with the transcription, we only need to
        adjust the id, and retrieve the corresponding page break to be done. The XQuery mapping
        function is thus rather simple: </para>
      <programlisting language="xquery" xml:space="preserve">declare function mapping:vg-translation($root as element()) {
    let $id := ``[pb-trans-`{$root/@f}`-`{$root/@n}`]``
    let $node := root($root)/id($id)
    return
        $node
};</programlisting>
      <para> Note that returning the corresponding <tag>pb</tag> node of the translation is
        sufficient here as further processing will automatically extract the page fragment up to the
        next <tag>pb</tag>. More complex cases may require that mapping function returns arbitrary
        TEI fragment. Also note that the <parameter>xpath</parameter> attribute of the
          <tag>pb-view</tag> element in the template must still point to the source transcription (
          <parameter> div[@type='original']</parameter> in this case). It's just the mapping
        function which translates a position in the source transcription to a corresponding fragment
        in the translation. </para>
      <para>The letter by Cortez to Dantiscus sent from Mexico demonstrates a much more
        sophisticated alignment, determining the translation fragment to be shown by inspecting the
        ID range of the transcription. It illustrates the case where no milestone elements exist in
        the translation to explicitly mark page boundaries of the original, thus mapping algorithm
        aims to display closest corresponding fragment of the translated text.</para>

    <title>Server-side API</title>
    <para> Many of the user interface web components need to communicate with the server to request
      certain data to be retrieved, processed and returned before the client-side components can
      display it to the user. For example, when user clicks the <guibutton>Table of
        Contents</guibutton> button, the corresponding <parameter>pb-load</parameter> component
      sends an ajax request to retrieve the list of chapters. Similarly, when user types something
      in the autocomplete field, a request is sent after each keystroke to find matching terms in
      the index. These requests need to be received and processed by the server with the eXist
      instance running and only then data will be returned to the browser. </para>

    <para>Previous versions of TEI Publisher included a number of XQuery modules implementing
      the server-side functionality, located in <parameter>modules</parameter> collection. In
      version 7, a new approach has been introduced. A formal <link xlink:href="../api.html"
        xlink:show="new">API specification</link>, based on the <link xlink:show="new"
        xlink:href="http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3">Open API standard</link>, defines all the
      server-side API endpoints available in Publisher. The library responsible for interpreting the Open API specification 
      and routing requests to XQuery endpoints is called <link xlink:href="https://github.com/eeditiones/roaster">roaster</link>
      and can also be used outside TEI Publisher.</para>

      <title>Custom API endpoints</title>
      <para> Beyond the standard server-side functionality provided by TEI Publisher, careful
        provisions have been made to allow users to add their own API endpoints. The <link
          xlink:href="../api.html#operations-tag-default" xlink:show="new">Custom API</link> section
        demonstrates how project-specific functionality can be added within the OAS API scheme. </para>
      <para>All that is required is to edit the <link xlink:href="modules/custom-api.json" role="source">modules/custom-api.json</link> file
        and add specifications for custom endpoints in JSON format. The
          <parameter>operationId</parameter> property specifies the XQuery function to be called to
        process the request. All function modules with API functions need to be imported
        into <link xlink:href="modules/custom-api.xql" role="source">modules/custom-api.xql</link> so that the request can be correctly
        resolved. </para>
      <para>The function implementation can either be added to the XQuery module <filename>
          modules/custom-api.xql</filename> or to a new module, which should be imported into this
        file to make it known. The <filename>modules/custom-api.xql</filename> shipping with TEI Publisher already 
        includes one custom endpoint used for the <link xlink:href="../encyclopedia" xlink:show="new">"Damen Conversations Lexikon"</link>: it returns a JSON structure for consumption
        by <tag>pb-split-list</tag>, displaying the list of available lemmata in the encyclopedia.</para>
      <para>In addition, it imports a separate module from <link xlink:href="modules/iiif.xql" role="source">modules/iiif.xql</link>, containing functions for
        generating a IIIF presentation manifest (see the <link xlink:href="../test/F-rom.xml" xlink:show="new">Shakespeare example</link>):</para>
      <synopsis language="xquery">import module namespace iiif="https://e-editiones.org/api/iiif" at "iiif.xql";</synopsis>
      <para>To reference a custom function in the <parameter>operationId</parameter> parameter of
        <filename>modules/custom-api.json</filename>, use the prefix <parameter>custom:</parameter> if the corresponding XQuery
        function is available in <filename>modules/custom-api.xql</filename>. If it resides in an imported module, use
        the prefix defined for the import. For the IIIF module import above, this would be <option>iiif</option>, so the operationId
        would read:</para>

    <title>URL Routing</title>
    <section xml:id="custom-urls">
      <title>Creating custom URLs</title>
      <para>By default, TEI Publisher addresses the different example pages by the name of the XML document displayed, which means users will see
        the relative path to the document in the URL. A request to <code>/test/adagia.xml</code> will be handled by the Open API route matching the 
        path <code>"/{docid}"</code>, which then calls the XQuery function <function>vapi:view</function> to retrieve the HTML template 
        associated with the TEI document and return it to the browser:</para>
      <programlisting language="javascript" xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
"/{docid}": {
	"get": {
		"summary": "Retrieve the HTML template used for displaying a document",
		"description": "Get the HTML template associated with the given document. This is called whenever the users tries to view a document. The actual content of the document will then be loaded by the template.",
		"tags": ["view"],
		"operationId": "vapi:view",
		"x-error-handler": "vapi:handle-error",
		...
	}
}
]]></programlisting>
      <para>Addressing by relative path is convenient for a heterogenous collection like the one in TEI Publisher, but for a more homogenous
        edition, you may prefer other addressing schemes, e.g. using an identifier. For example, the Alfred Escher Briefedition uses URLs like 
        <link xlink:href="https://briefedition.alfred-escher.ch/briefe/B0017" xlink:show="new">https://briefedition.alfred-escher.ch/briefe/B0017</link>. Using an abstract identifier has the advantage that bookmarked URLs
        remain accessible even if the implementation changes (as happened for Escher), given that the identifier is stable. An even more complex addressing scheme can be found in the <link xlink:href="https://www.johannconradfischer.com" xlink:show="new">Johann Conrad Fischer</link> edition. Here the different travel journals are addressed by the year they cover, and the chapter to show is given as a number. Additionally, the language is given in the first path parameter, so the resulting URLs have the form: <code>/language/year/chapter</code>, e.g. <code>/de/1794/9</code>. Obviously implementing a scheme like this requires a bit more tweaking, so we'll concentrate on simpler cases like the one in Escher.
      </para>
      <para>TEI Publisher includes two examples, which deviate from the default addressing scheme:</para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>TEI Publisher documentation</term>
          <listitem><para>The entire documentation is contained in one file. Users may want to copy or bookmark a specific section, whose identifier is thus encoded in the URL using a scheme <code>/documentation/{identifier}</code>.</para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><link xlink:href="../encyclopedia" xlink:show="new">Damen Conversations Lexikon</link></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>An early 19th century encyclopedia in German. An encyclopedia or dictionary is usually not read page by page. Instead users will want to browse to a particular headword they are interested in. Accordingly, the URL should reflect the chosen headword rather than the document. URLs are thus of the form <code>/encyclopedia/{headword}</code>.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      <para>Both examples need two route definitions: the first corresponding to the root page displayed, i.e. if the user has not selected a chapter or headword, the second to represent the detail view of a chapter or headword. For the documentation, <link xlink:href="modules/custom-api.json" role="source">modules/custom-api.json</link> thus has configurations for <code>/documentation</code> as well as <code>/documentation/{id}</code>. In both cases we simply copied and modified the configuration for the standard path, i.e. <code>"/{docid}"</code>, from <link xlink:href="modules/lib/api.json" role="source">modules/lib/api.json</link>.</para>
    <para>The default endpoint takes various parameter, including two required ones: <parameter>docid</parameter> for the path to the TEI document, and <parameter>template</parameter> to specify the HTML template to use. For the documentation those will always be the same, i.e. <filename>doc/documentation.xml</filename> and <filename>pages/documentation.html</filename>, so we can pass them as a default value. This way we can reuse the existing operation (<function>vapi:view</function>) and don't have to write a custom handler function in XQuery!</para>
      <para>We also add two parameters, <parameter>id</parameter> and <parameter>base</parameter>. The first will take the <option>xml:id</option> of the chapter we're looking for. <parameter>id</parameter> is one of the standard parameters picked up by the <tag>pb-view</tag> in the HTML when loading the actual content to display. <parameter>base</parameter> will be used in the template to set the HTML <tag>base</tag> tag in the HTML head. This is required to tell the browser where images and other resources should be loaded from:</para>
      <programlisting language="html" xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<head>
  <base href="${base}" data-template="pages:parse-params"/>
  ...
</head>]]></programlisting>
      <para>The complete definition of the route in <link xlink:href="modules/custom-api.json" role="source">modules/custom-api.json</link> looks like this:</para>

}]]></programlisting>
      <para>This handles the server-side routing of requests. However, there's also a client-side aspect, which we'll cover in the next chapter.</para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="client-side-urls">
      <title>Adjusting the client-side URL handling</title>
      <para>With the two routes we set up for the documentation in the previous section, we cover the cases in which the entire page is loaded or reloaded by the browser, either by following a link, selecting a bookmark or pasting an URL into the location bar. However, TEI Publisher is a highly dynamic application and users can interact with the page without reloading it, e.g. by navigating to the next page of the document, selecting a toggle, clickling a link in the table of contents etc. Client-side interactions like this also need to be recorded and should be reflected in the URL, so users can copy or bookmark it. And the bookmarked link should later reconstitute the page in the state it was in when the bookmark was created.</para>
      <para>All client-side web components in TEI Publisher therefore use a central state registry to track their state and reflect it in the URL. You can see this in action when you open any of the larger sample documents and navigate between its pages using the navigation buttons: the URL shown in the browser's location bar will change. For simple documents like <link xlink:href="../test/kant_rvernunft_1781.TEI-P5.xml" xlink:show="new">Kant's Kritik</link>, the current page displayed will be encoded in the <parameter>root</parameter> parameter. If the divisions or pages to navigate by have an <code>xml:id</code>, this will be used instead and placed into the <parameter>id</parameter> parameter. The path to the TEI document is also tracked (it's the <code>test/kant_rvernunft_1781.TEI-P5.xml</code> part of the URL), though you won't see it change while navigating.</para>
      <para>For the documentation we deviate from this default pattern with the relative URL becoming <code>documentation/{id}</code>. We thus need to inform the client-side components about the change, so they know how to store their state into the URL. The central <tag>pb-page</tag> component provides two attributes for this:</para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>url-template</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>A template expression containing placeholders for the parameters to be filled in. The template uses the same syntax and library as the popular <link xlink:href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-paths" xlink:show="new">Express javascript framework</link>.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>url-ignore</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>A comma-separated list of parameter names which should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be reflected in the URL.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      <para>The expression passed to url-template may reference any of the default parameters known to TEI Publisher components, in particular <parameter>path</parameter>, <parameter>odd</parameter>, <parameter>view</parameter> or <parameter>id</parameter>. Additionally, any parameter supplied to a <tag>pb-view</tag> via the <tag>pb-param</tag> element can be referenced. Just have a look at the constructed URLs in the browser to see which parameters are being tracked for a specific page. Within TEI Publisher, URL templates will usually be rather simple. For the full syntax supported check the underlying <link xlink:href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regexp" xlink:show="new">javascript library</link>.</para>
      <para>To handle the URL for the documentation example, we set the URL template to <code>documentation/:id?</code>. This injects the <option>id</option> parameter as part of the path, e.g. <code>/documentation/api</code>. The ? after the parameter indicates that it is optional. We also do not want the <code>path</code> to the document to appear anywhere (it is always the same in the case), so we add it to <code>url-ignore</code>. The resulting <tag>pb-page</tag> would thus look as follows:</para>
      <synopsis language="html"><![CDATA[<pb-page url-template="documentation/:id?" url-ignore="odd,view,path" data-template="pages:pb-page" unresolved="unresolved" >]]></synopsis>
        <note>
          <title>A note on history handling</title>
          <para>It is important that only one central text component on the page writes and reads the URL. Usually this will be the main <tag>pb-view</tag>. Other components, e.g. for the translation, should be made dependent and restore their state based on the state of the main component. If multiple components write their state, browsing back via the browser history may not work properly, or you may see undesired effects due to conflicting parameters.</para>
          <para>TEI Publisher supports different ways to make one <tag>pb-view</tag> depend on another, e.g. via a mapping function (<parameter>map</parameter> attribute). A mapped view will never write to the browser history.</para>
          <para>In other cases, to explicitely prevent a dependent <tag>pb-view</tag> from writing to the URL, use the attribute <parameter>disable-history</parameter>. To make a <tag>pb-view</tag> load its contents <emphasis>after</emphasis> the main text view, set attribute <parameter>on-update</parameter> and make sure, the dependent component listens to the event channel written by the main component.</para>

      <para>All these can be stored in JSON language files, following the same naming conventions
        and basic structure as TEI Publisher ones. To use custom language files, you need to specify
        the path under which they can be found relative to your application:</para>
      <programlisting language="html" xml:space="preserve">&lt;pb-page locales="resources/i18n/{{ns}}/{{lng}}.json"&gt;</programlisting>

          <listitem>
            <para> the namespace prefix used to distinguish between different collections of
              language files. By default, TEI Publisher expects custom language files to be in a
              namespace called <code>app</code>, though this can be configured. </para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      <para> So given above configuration, TEI Publisher will search for a custom language file for,
        say, French in <code>resources/i18n/app/fr.json</code>. If you prefer a flat directory
        structure, you could change the <parameter>locale</parameter> to <code>
          resources/i18n/{{ns}}_{{lng}}.json</code> and TEI Publisher will look for a file <code>
          resources/i18n/app_fr.json</code>. </para>
      <para> You may also define additional namespaces to be searched with the <parameter>
          locale-fallback-ns</parameter> parameter: </para>
      <programlisting language="html" xml:space="preserve">&lt;pb-page locales="resources/i18n/{{ns}}/{{lng}}.json"
        locale-fallback-ns="app my-module"&gt;</programlisting>
      <para> which means that TEI Publisher will search for labels in the <code>my-module</code>
        namespace first, then falling back to the <code>app</code> namespace, and if the label could
        still not be found, using TEI Publisher's default namespace. The latter is called <code>
          common</code> and should not be overwritten. </para>
      <para> Listing below demonstrates a fictional <filename>en.js</filename> with a custom set of
        labels. A new top-level key has been added as well as 3 subkeys for the <code>menu</code>
        section. Now the project has access to a number of new i18n keys: <code>menu.about</code>,
          <code> menu.contact</code>, <code>menu.statute</code> and <code>greeting</code>. </para>
      <para> Furthermore, a value for <code>menu.documentation</code> has been specified. That key

    <title>Creating applications with the App Generator</title>
    <para>Once you are happy with a certain ODD and HTML template customization, you can easily
      create a complete, standalone application. Such application can be tailored further to fit
      your needs. The generated app can be downloaded as a portable xar package, to be installed
      into other eXist instances, or synchronised to disk for further development. It provides a
      fully functional application scaffolding based on TEI Publisher components and modules,
      pre-configured to use a certain ODD, page template and other settings.</para>
    <note>
      <title>Note</title>
      <para>Early versions of the TEI Publisher included everything they needed to run without TEI
        Publisher. This had some advantages, but also made it more difficult to update to newer
        releases.</para>
      <para> Starting with version 5 we are gradually moving towards more lightweight app design,
        ultimately containing only resources which are truly specific to the app (ODDs, HTML
        templates, images), while all generic functionality will be provided by TEI Publisher and
        its libraries and packages. Version 6 has seen all web components extracted into <code>
          pb-components</code> package and in version 7 the server-side code has been based on a
        well designed API specification with provisions for easy customization.

        <para>For performance reasons, the mechanism used by generated apps to transform a document
          via an ODD is slightly different to the one in the main TEI Publisher app: while TEI
          Publisher resolves ODDs dynamically, generated apps use a static lookup method. </para>
        <para>The static method is much faster, resulting in better overall performance, but as a
          consequence ODDs are not automatically detected by the app, and need to be explicitly
          registered.</para>
        <para> Each generated app will by default use a single ODD for all transformations but it is
          possible to add additional ODDs, e.g. to be used with a <code>pb-view</code> in a custom
          HTML template. If multiple ODDs are selected when generating the app, the app generator
          will take care of registering those ODDs. If you would like to add ODDs manually later,

        your choice, which you can then commit to a version control system like git. </para>
      <para>However, if you continue to make changes inside the database (e.g. further work on the
        ODD), you may want to use the second method, i.e. call eXide's synchronization. It requires
        that you have access to the file system of the server running eXist though, so it's usually
        only an option if you run your own eXist instance locally. The synchronize steps in

    <title>Updating Applications</title>
    <para>Custom applications are created from a specific version of TEI Publisher and may need to be updated over time to benefit from bug fixes and new features. If you followed the <link linkend="customization-best-practice">best practice recommendations</link>, you can always update the core of TEI Publisher by replacing the <filename>modules/lib</filename> directory with the newer version. However, you may also need to adjust the configuration and code modules outside this directory to match the new release (details concerning a particular version are documented below). This obviously also applies to any custom code you have added or modified yourself. In general we would recommend the following procedure:</para>
    <procedure>
      <step><para>Replace <filename>modules/lib</filename></para></step>
      <step><para>Check <filename>expath-pkg.xml</filename> for changed dependencies</para></step>

      <step><para>Once the app starts and is functionally working, you can look into replacing other files, e.g. the global CSS file in <filename>resources/css/theme.css</filename></para></step>
    </procedure>
    
    <para>For apps created with TEI Publisher 6 updating to 7 or 8 requires only small modifications.

      <title>Upgrading from TEI Publisher 6 to 7</title>
      <para>With TEI Publisher 7, we have redesigned the server-side API. Combined with the
        client-side reorganization brought by TEI Publisher 6, this will make future updates for

        separated from any custom app elements.</para>
      <para> To upgrade a custom application generated with TEI Publisher 6 to version 7, we
        recommend to clone the source code of both, TEI Publisher 7 and the custom application, into

          >updating the Dodis demo app</link>, but with appropriate adjustments to the syntax the
        same actions could be performed on a different operating system. Alternatively the migration
        can be executed using eXide's file manager. </para>
      <para>If you decide to work with the command line, as suggested here, clone TEI Publisher 7

    <title>Data</title>
    <para>TEI Publisher ships its data files within the same application package. Nevertheless,
      separating your data from application code has many benefits, particularly for actively
      developed applications and data sets. This way changes to your code can be deployed without
      redeploying and reindexing your data and vice versa. It is also easier to maintain separate
      repositories (e.g. in Git) and differentiate privileges for editorial and developer
      teams.</para>
    <para> While we would generally recommend separating data and code, some projects may still
      prefer to keep their data and application integrated in a single <emphasis>xar</emphasis>
      package for the sake of marginally easier distribution. </para>
    <para>Internal structure of the data collection can be arbitrary, though there are some
      considerations regarding index configuration to take into account.</para>
    <section xml:id="data-collection">
      <title>Data collection</title>
      <para> Two variables in <filename>config.xqm</filename> are used to configure location of the
        data collection. <code>$config:data-root</code> specifies where in the collection hierarchy
        the data is stored. Only the top level collection needs to be specified. </para>
      <programlisting language="xquery" xml:space="preserve">
(:~
 : The root of the collection hierarchy containing data.
 :)
declare variable $config:data-root := $config:app-root || "/data";
    </programlisting>
      <para> Switching to a separate data package is as simple as changing this variable, e.g.
        assuming that we store our data in <code>/db/apps/lgpn-ling-data/data</code>, the <code>
          data-root</code> should be defined as: </para>
      <programlisting language="xquery" xml:space="preserve">
      declare variable $config:data-root := '/db/apps/lgpn-ling-data/data';
    </programlisting>
      <para> In the variable <parameter>$config:data-exclude</parameter> you may specifiy a sequence
        of root elements which should be excluded from the list of document shown in the browsing
        view, e.g. secondary data files like a taxonomy or entity lists. </para>
      <para> You may find it helpful to create and build the data package starting from the template
        hosted in the <link xlink:href="https://github.com/eeditiones/tei-publisher-data-template"
          xlink:show="new">e-editiones repository</link>. README document provided there explains
        shortly roles of all the files and how to adjust them to your needs. </para>

      <note>
        <para> It is critical to store index configuration file,
            <filename>collection.xconf</filename> in the correct location. Refer to <link
            xlink:href="https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/indexing.xml" xlink:show="new">eXist-db
            documentation</link> for details but it is common practice to store a collection
          configuration in the data package and rely on mechanisms of pre-install script (
            <filename> pre-install.xql</filename>) to copy the file to its required position in
            <filename> /db/system/config</filename>. </para>
        <para> Similar consideration applies if fulltext index makes use of any external function
          module, which in TEI Publisher and generated apps is commonly the case for facet and field
          definitions. This module needs to be stored before the index is to be applied and usually
          it's best to store it in the same location as <filename>collection.xconf</filename>.
        </para>
      </note>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="subcollections">
      <title>Subcollections</title>
      <para> Many editions will simply present a number of documents, e.g. a collection of letters
        like <link xlink:href="https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/vangogh/index.html"
          xlink:show="new">Van Gogh</link> or plays like <link
          xlink:href="https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/shakespeare-pm/index.html"
          >Shakespeare</link> demo. Structure of the data is therefore very simple, all the files
        are stored on the same level in the <code>data-root</code> collection. </para>

      <para> Other publications, particularly those including heterogeneous material may require a
        more complex organization. TEI Publisher itself is a good example - its <code>data</code>
        collection is further divided into three subcollections: <filename>doc</filename> (for
        documentation), <filename>test</filename> (for examples) and <filename>playground</filename>
        (for user-supplied material). </para>

      <para> You will note that it also contains other resources: image files and even an HTML file.
        Specify the <code>$config:data-default</code> variable in
          <filename>modules/config.xqm</filename> to set which collection should be used as a point
        of entry to your data. Whenever <filename> collection.html</filename> is present in that
        location, it will be used as a custom landing page displayed instead of a simple document
        listing. In case of the TEI Publisher it would be the Demo Collection, Playground and
        Documentation </para>

        use (along with other configuration parameters). For example, the following processing
        instruction associates the document with the view template

    <title>Facet Search Configuration</title>
    <para>Facets allow users to quickly navigate through a set of documents or query results by
      selecting from predefined categories or properties. This way, users can "drill down" into the
      set, reducing the number of displayed items with every step. For demonstration purposes, TEI
      Publisher configures two facets by default: "Genre" and "Language". You can see those to the
      left of the document list on the start page, or below the search box on the search result
      page.</para>

    </figure>
    <para> From a user perspective, the main concept behind facets is the <emphasis>drill
        down</emphasis> : initially the user sees all facet values associated with the set of
      documents or search results displayed. The number behind each value denotes the number of
      items in the set having the particular facet set. As the user selects one facet, the set
      necessarily becomes smaller, so non-matching facet values will disappear and the numbers
      adjust accordingly. </para>
    <para> Facets are a new feature in eXist 5.0. They are super fast because eXist will create them
      when indexing the document. No extra computation is needed when the user clicks on a facet to
      drill down into a displayed set: all information is already available in the index. To see a
      more complex example of facets in action, visit our <link xlink:show="new"
        xlink:href="https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/vangogh/index.html">Van Gogh</link> demo. </para>
    <para>If you would like to configure other or additional facets, you need to edit three
      files:</para>

      <varlistentry>

          <filename>collection.xconf</filename>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para> The <filename>collection.xconf</filename> tells eXist how to index the collection.
            The default configuration in TEI Publisher creates two Lucene full-text indexes for TEI
            on <tag>tei:text</tag> and <tag>tei:div</tag>. Each of those may have facets attached.
            Every facet must have a <parameter>dimension</parameter> and an

            XPath/XQuery string. For every element being indexed, the expression is evaluated once

            facet dimension. </para>

          <para> If you open the default <filename>collection.xconf</filename>, you'll see that most

            separate function, we can keep the index configuration clean and short. </para>
          <para> The default <filename>index.xql</filename> already does some advanced
            preprocessing, in particular for the "genre" facet: each of the sample documents
            references a central taxonomy (contained in <filename>data/taxonomy.xml</filename>). The
            references are resolved at indexing time by following the <tag>catRef</tag> element's
              <parameter>@target</parameter> attribute. Note that we create a hierarchical facet,
            because e.g. "Philosophy" is a sub-category of "Prose". The code in function <function>
              idx:get-genre</function> will automatically include the super-category. </para>

    <title>Embedding TEI Publisher in other systems</title>
    <para> Since version 6.0, all <code>pb-components</code> can be used
        <emphasis>outside</emphasis> TEI Publisher itself. The components can be embedded into any
      environment, e.g. a CMS or blog software (like WordPress or Drupal) or integrated into any
      modern front-end framework (like vue, react or angular). All that is needed is a TEI Publisher
      instance available on the web which stores the source TEI and provides a communication
      endpoint for the components to talk to. </para>

    <section xml:id="embedding-examples">
      <title>Live Examples</title>
      <para> The embedded example below demonstrates such a use case: it provides a sandbox running
        on <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="https://codepen.io">codepen.io</link> but communicates
        with the TEI Publisher instance on <link xlink:show="new"
          xlink:href="https://teipublisher.com">teipublisher.com</link> which stores the documents.
        The magic happens in the <code>endpoint</code> attribute passed to <tag>pb-page</tag>, which
        tells the components where to talk to: </para>
      <programlisting role="codepen" xlink:href="wolfgangmm#YzXEvvw"/>
      <para> You can actually edit the code above: for example, try to change the path for the first
        document to <filename>test/F-rom.xml</filename> and the odd to <code>shakespeare</code>. See
        how the live view changes? </para>
      <para> And if you would like to read <emphasis>Romeo and Juliet</emphasis> in two-column mode,
        just add <code>column-separator=".tei-cb"</code> to the main <tag>pb-view</tag>. </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="embedding-whole-doc">
      <title>Retrieving the whole document as a simple HTML</title>
      <!-- REVIEW: shall we leave the description how to write your own XQuery or should we
      recommend only using new API for transformations? -->
      <para>Embedding results of applying Processing Model transformation on a document is even
        simpler. Behind the scenes, TEI Publisher has a separate library part, which is essentially
        an implementation of the TEI processing model. This library can be used independently to
        retrieve the entire content of a TEI document as HTML, transformed through an ODD with
        processing instructions.</para>
      <para>All you need is a small XQuery which calls the library modules, setting the correct
        source document and ODD. Fortunately, TEI Publisher already contains a boilerplate XQuery
        script for this job, which you can call as follows in your browser:</para>
      <para>
        <link xlink:show="new"
          xlink:href="https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/api/document/test%2FF-rom.xml/html?odd=shakespeare.odd"

          https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/api/document/test%2FF-rom.xml/html?odd=shakespeare.odd</link>
      </para>
      <para> This will retrieve the content of Shakespeare's <emphasis>Romeo and Juliet</emphasis>
        as an HTML page, transformed through the odd <filename>shakespeare.odd</filename>. For
        embedding an entire document in an iframe or similar, this should already be enough. Please
        note that <emphasis role="bold">/</emphasis> character in the path to the document
          <parameter> test/F-rom.xml</parameter> had to be URL encoded as <parameter>%2F</parameter>
        . </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="embedding-webcomponents">
      <title>Embedding webcomponents for navigation</title>
      <para>For longer documents, embedding the entire content in a page may not be too
        user-friendly. A better way is to use the library of webcomponents provided by TEI
        Publisher. This way, we can show the content page by page or division by division, allowing
        the reader to navigate between sections.</para>
      <programlisting role="codepen" xlink:href="wolfgangmm#ExVQKBK"/>
      <para>Because webcomponents are part of the HTML5 standard and supported natively by most
        modern browsers, we can easily import the component library which is at the core of the TEI
        Publisher app and reuse the components it provides in other contexts. They should work in
        any HTML5 page, no matter if it was written by hand, is generated by PHP, Python or a
        CMS.</para>
      <para>For a start, the page should import two scripts in its header:</para>
      <programlisting language="html" xml:space="preserve">&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/web-components-loader/lib/index.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@teipublisher/pb-components/dist/pb-components-bundle.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</programlisting>
      <para> This imports necessary <code>pb-components</code> libraries from
          <code>jsdelivr.net</code> CDN which is considered the best practice for web sites. </para>
      <para> The second <tag>script</tag> tag imports all the components provided by TEI Publisher.
        Note that here <code>pb-components@latest</code> points to the latest available bundle, but
        you could specify a concrete version number to make sure your website uses a fixed release. </para>

      <para> Now let's actually use the components to display Shakespeare's <emphasis>Romeo and
          Juliet</emphasis> : in the HTML <tag>body</tag>, include the following snippet: </para>
      <programlisting language="html" xml:space="preserve">&lt;pb-page endpoint="https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher"&gt;
    &lt;pb-document id="document1" path="test/F-rom.xml" odd="shakespeare"&gt;&lt;/pb-document&gt;
    &lt;!-- Navigate to previous page --&gt;
    &lt;pb-navigation direction="backward" unit="page" keyboard="left"&gt;
      &lt;paper-button&gt;
         &lt;iron-icon icon="icons:chevron-left"&gt;&lt;/iron-icon&gt;
      &lt;/paper-button&gt;
    &lt;/pb-navigation&gt;
    &lt;pb-view id="view1" src="document1" view="page"&gt;&lt;/pb-view&gt;
    &lt;!-- Navigate to next page --&gt;
    &lt;pb-navigation direction="forward" unit="page" keyboard="right"&gt;
      &lt;paper-button&gt;
         &lt;iron-icon icon="icons:chevron-right"&gt;&lt;/iron-icon&gt;
      &lt;/paper-button&gt;
    &lt;/pb-navigation&gt;
&lt;/pb-page&gt;</programlisting>
      <para> In the <tag>pb-page</tag>
        <code>endpoint</code> attribute we need to provide a critical piece of information: the URL
        of the TEI Publisher instance for all the components to communicate with. If you have set up
        your own instance of eXist-db and TEI Publisher, you should change the URL <emphasis>to
          point to your instance</emphasis>. This is important because the components will expect
        the documents you want to display to be stored in the same instance. </para>
      <para>
        <tag>pb-document</tag> defines the document to be displayed. The path is relative to the
        data root of the TEI Publisher instance. It also specifies the ODD to be used for the
        transformation. </para>
      <para>
        <tag>pb-view</tag> is the main component for displaying the transformed content. It
        references the <tag>pb-document</tag> to use as source in its <option>src</option>
        attribute. The Shakespeare does tag page breaks, so we switch to page-by-page view via the
          <option> view</option> attribute to show the user only one page at a time. The default
        would be to use a division-by-division view (<code>view="div"</code>), but you could also
        request the entire content at once using <code>view="single"</code>. </para>
      <para>
        <tag>pb-navigation</tag> adds forward/backward navigation buttons to the page, allowing the
        user to switch to the next/previous page of the document. You can use various types of
        buttons, but in this case we're choosing a <tag>paper-button</tag> element with a chevron
          <tag> iron-icon</tag> (both <tag>paper-button</tag> and <tag>iron-icon</tag> are part of
        the standard <link xlink:show="new"
          xlink:href="https://www.webcomponents.org/author/PolymerElements">Polymer elements
          library</link>). </para>
      <para> Another example of embedding TEI Publisher web components into a static website can be
        found on our <link xlink:href="https://teipublisher.onrender.com/">demo blog</link>. It was
        created with <link xlink:href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</link>, a very popular website
        generator which offers hundreds of ready-made themes to choose from. Here content is written
        in markdown, but its not a problem to embed TEI content served by TEI Publisher. </para>

      <title>pb-clipboard example</title>
      <para> We will discuss the details of the <tag>pb-clipboard</tag> element to illustrate some
        basic concepts. You will find exact code of this example in <code>
          pb-extension-template/src/pb-clipboard.js</code>. Each custom component has a defined API:
        an interface it presents to the outside world. It includes properties, methods (also called
        functions) and events but it bundles HTML markup along with local CSS and JavaScript into a
        single file. </para>
      <para> Our example is a custom element designed to provide simple
          <emphasis>copy-to-clipboard</emphasis> functionality, helpful e.g. when providing
        ready-made citation on a page. It consists of three parts: a label, the content to be copied
        and a button to copy. </para>
      <para>Thus, render function which actually displays this custom component could look like
        this:</para>
      <programlisting language="js" xml:space="preserve">
    render() {
        return html`
            &lt;h3&gt;${translate(this.label)}&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
                &lt;paper-icon-button icon="icons:content-copy" @click="${this._copy}"
                    title="${translate('clipboard.copy')}"&gt;&lt;/paper-icon-button&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        `;
    }
      </programlisting>
      <para> You will note that the render function uses not only regular HTML elements like
          <tag>h3</tag> or <tag>div</tag> but also components from the <code>paper-</code> package.
        To be able to use them, we need to explicitly import them. Same is true for
          <code>LitElement</code> class itself and important interface from the
          <code>pb-components</code> package: <code>pbMixin</code>. </para>
      <para> All user interface components may need to be localized. For that reason we also import
          <code> translate</code> method from TEI Publisher's <code>i18n</code> module. </para>
      <para>
        <code>LitElement</code> and <code>pbMixin</code> must be imported for all custom components
        extending <code>pb-components</code>. Code listing below demonstrates how to correctly
        import all classes and custom elements required as well as how to create a class signature
        that extends <code>pbMixin</code>. </para>

      <para> You probably noticed that the button we added in the <function>render</function>
        function specifies what to do upon click event via <code>click</code> attribute: <code>
          @click="${this._copy}"</code>. A protected <function>_copy</function> function of the
        element is called in such case and for our simple <code>pb-clipboard</code> element it
        provides its core <emphasis>copy-to-clipboard</emphasis> functionality. </para>

        corresponding label in i18n language files. It could be one of keys shipping with TEI
        Publisher, but here, for a new component we need a more specific label, presenting the user
        with a short, informative text to be displayed when hovering over <emphasis>
          copy-to-clipboard</emphasis> button. Obviously, the label should change in line with the
        language setting for the whole application, which is why we need the i18n module in the

  <section xml:id="new-vocabulary">
    <title>Adding a custom vocabulary</title>
    <para>As discussed in the opening chapter, publishing a corpus of documents online is much more
      than just transforming a single source document into the desired output format. To fully
      support a new XML vocabulary in TEI Publisher several aspects need to be adressed:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>ODD with processing models</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>default view and page template</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>navigation, breadcrumbs and table of contents</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>search and filtering: full text index definitions, facets and fields</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>ODD and processing models within it govern how the document in your new vocabulary will be
      transformed into a range of available output formats: HTML, ePub etc.</para>
    <para> All other aspects are interconnected and depend on the understanding what constitutes the
      basic unit of the text: TEI primarily considers <emphasis>divisions</emphasis> or <emphasis>
        pages</emphasis>, DocBook rather <emphasis>sections</emphasis>. Therefore navigation for TEI
      document will be switching between <tag>div</tag> s or reconstructed XML fragments between
      subsequent <tag>pb</tag> s, while talking about pages in DocBook documents makes no sense and
        <tag> section</tag> s are the main structural units. </para>
    <para> This structure has its consequences for further aspects: generating TOC in TEI will
      analyze nested <tag>div</tag> / <tag>head</tag> structures but only <tag>section</tag> / 
      <tag>title</tag> in DocBook. Likewise, KWIC display in TEI will be showing matches in
        <tag>div</tag> context but <tag>section</tag> in DocBook, so Lucene indexes need to be
      defined on these elements in their appropriate namespaces. Ditto for facets and fields used
      for sorting and filtering. </para>
    <para>Sections below will explain where and how to customize these aspects in more
      detail.</para>
    <section xml:id="new-vocabulary-odd">
      <title>ODD</title>
      <para> Create a new, blank ODD file which is not chained to any other ODD and add <tag>
          elementSpec</tag> s for its elements. Make sure that you specify correct namespace for
        your vocabulary. Optionally, you can also specify an external CSS file with style
        declarations for classes and elements you will be using in processing models of your ODD. </para>
      <para>See how it looks in the ODD for DocBook.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para> When adding models into the custom ODD for your vocabulary it is recommended that at
        least one element applies the <parameter>document</parameter> behaviour. Usually it will be
        the top level element or the main content-bearing one (like <tag>article</tag> in DocBook). </para>
      <para> This is not strictly required but for print output via LaTeX or FO the <parameter>
          document</parameter> behaviour specifies default prologue governing basic setup for PDF.
        If you refer to the <filename>docbook.odd</filename> you will note that the same effect is
        achieved by explicitly defining the prologue in the <tag>pb:template</tag> for <parameter>
          article</parameter>. </para>
      <section xml:id="new-vocabulary-foo">
        <title>Case study: foo vocabulary</title>

        <programlisting>http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/tei-publisher/playground/foo.xml</programlisting>
        <para> Fixing this will require creating a new ODD for <emphasis>foo</emphasis> vocabulary. </para>
        <para> Create a new ODD as described previously. Use <parameter>document</parameter>
          behaviour for <tag>fooStart</tag> element and perhaps <tag>inline</tag> with an <tag>
            outputRendition</tag> set to <parameter>italic</parameter> for <tag>foo</tag> element.
          Please note to specify the ODD for your vocabulary. </para>

          <para> It is necessary to use <parameter>single</parameter> view along with the

            in TEI Publisher is normally set to <parameter>div</parameter>. As we already mentioned,
            implementation of view parameters needs to be vocabulary-specific to work. Since
              <emphasis> foo</emphasis> vocabulary doesn't yet have navigation customized, TEI
            Publisher will fall back to TEI and try to locate <tag>tei:div</tag> elements, which

    <title>Annotating Documents</title>
    <para>Since version 7.1.0, TEI Publisher supports annotating TEI documents via a graphic, web
      based interface. This means you can enhance existing TEI documents directly within TEI
      Publisher in a user-friendly environment where XML code is neatly hidden from sight when not
      needed.</para>
    <para>The annotation editor is not meant for creating documents from scratch but targets one of
      the most tedious and time consuming tasks in any edition project: adding semantic, analytic or
      text-critical markup to an existing transcription.</para>

    <para>Typical workflow for many projects will resemble the following:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>An initial transcription is created, either manually in a text editor, or using OCR or
          HTR tools like Transkribus. It contains the basic structural markup, i.e. divisions,
          headings, paragraphs etc.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>That initial transcription is gradually enriched: textual features like emphasis can
          be marked, abbreviations expanded, corrections and regularizations applied; people, places
          or terms appearing in the text can be explicitly tagged and linked to an authority; dates
          or measures normalized. This is an iterative process: the resulting TEI encoding is
          constantly reviewed, which may result in further changes to be made.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>Web annotations try to ease the burden of the enrichment phase by allowing editors to mark
      everything directly within the user-friendly environment, closely resembling the publication
      view. It is much easier to read and doesn't require half as much TEI experience as using an
      XML editor. Just use your mouse to highlight the text fragment to annotate, click on the
      annotation type and optionally select additional information, e.g. to link with an external
      authority file.</para>

      <para>Annotations have been extensively tested, and should work reliably for tagging entities

    <section>
      <title>Annotations: the pen and paper of the digital world</title>
      <para>How the annotation editor works is easy to understand if you imagine reviewing a text
        the old-fashioned way: print it out, then use a marker to highlight certain passages, write
        corrections over the text with a pen, or scribble notes into the margin. Once back at your
        computer, all the changes need to be transferred into the TEI. You may then continue with a
        second round of review by printing out the results again.</para>

      <para>Within our electronic environment, the printout corresponds to the source TEI document
        and the marks and scribbles are annotations. Until you explicitely merge the annotations
        into the source TEI, they will be kept separate from the document they apply to. Once
        merged, a new version of the source TEI document is established and the editing process
        restarts.</para>
      <para>Notably, TEI Publisher is able to detect existing markup in the base text when it is
        loaded. Any markup corresponding to a known annotation type will be recognized and displayed
        as such, therefore it can be modified. In this sense it is slightly different from working
        with pen and paper.</para>
      <para>From the printout example it should be clear that you cannot change the printed text
        itself (unless you had some magic paper). Accordingly, annotations are not allowed to change
        the base text, i.e. the text "printed" on the screen. If you want to explicitly indicate a
        correction, you can use the <emphasis>corr</emphasis> or <emphasis>reg</emphasis> annotation
        type, which corresponds to the TEI encoding with choice/sic/corr or choice/orig/reg. </para>
      <para>You can use annotations for virtually any kind of inline markup. The only strict
        requirement is that the <emphasis>base text</emphasis>, our source document, remains stable
          <emphasis>during an editing session</emphasis> i.e. until annotations are merged. The
        reason for that is the annotations are anchored to a certain position in the document, so
        any changes to it would mean that our coordinates might suddenly point to different
        fragments.</para>
      <para>That said, there's also a special <emphasis>edit</emphasis> annotation type, which does
        allow you to perform limited editing of a text. It will just "seamlessly" change the
        transcription text fragment without adding any explicit markup. Nevertheless, such a change
        to the TEI document is only applied when you merge and therefore establish a new base text.
        The limitation is that only text fragments can be edited: the boundaries of structural
        markup or annotations may not be crossed. It can be convenient for fixing a typo in a
        transcription that wasn’t caught when the base text was prepared.</para>
      <para>You also cannot use the annotation editor to modify the structural markup of the base
        text, i.e. block-level elements like divs, paragraphs, headings or notes. In case you need
        to change the structure, you have to merge your annotations first, saving a new version of
        the TEI document and switch to an XML editor to change the XML there. The new document can
        be then reloaded into the annotation editor and you can continue.</para>
      <para>As already indicated, it is possible to handle common nested encoding structures like
          <tag> choice</tag> or <tag>app</tag> as annotations. Nevertheless the inner elements, i.e.
          <tag>lem</tag>, <tag>rdg</tag>, <tag>sic</tag>, <tag>corr</tag> or <tag>orig</tag>,
          <tag>reg</tag>, need to have simple text content: they cannot be annotated themselves (at
        least not in the current version).</para>

      <para>Depending on the chosen annotation type, a form will appear beneath the toolbar. We

          <listitem>
            <para>semantic annotations, which are (usually) connected to an external authority, e.g.
              for people, places, organizations or terms.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>"toggle" annotations, which do not need require additional information, so they
              simply switch an annotation on/off, e.g. for deletions or titles (not part of the
              default annotation editor setup).</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>analytic or text critical annotations, which may require further input from the
              user, e.g. a normalized date.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist> These categories are not mutually exclusive but may be helpful to explain the
        main functional differences between the three use scenarios. </para>
      <section>
        <title>Semantic Annotations</title>
        <para>Semantic annotations include markup for entities like people, places or terms. Most
          editions will try to link those to a description of the entity, either provided by an
          external authority file or from a local resource. In any case you will want to reference a
          unique identifier to mark occurrences of the same entity throughout the edition.</para>
        <para>When choosing a semantic annotation from the toolbar, you will thus see a dialog which
          runs a query against the authority file configured for the annotation type, e.g. Geonames
          for places or GND for people. </para>
        <figure>

          </mediaobject>
        </figure>
        <para>The semantic annotation dialog displays the query results for you to choose from and
          the query sent initially corresponds to the text selection made. Often this may not find
          the relevant entity, but you can change the query in the input field on top of the dialog
          and run the search again by pressing enter. Compare the screenshots above and below to
          note the difference when searching for <emphasis>William</emphasis> vs <emphasis>William

          </mediaobject>
        </figure>
        <para>When you use the + sign to select an authority entry, its ID will be copied into the
          top input field in the left sidebar and a short description of the entity should appear
          beneath. The ID will be used as reference in the resulting TEI, i.e. it will appear in an
          attribute attached to e.g. <tag>persName</tag> or other TEI element. The exact mapping
          between an annotation type and a TEI snippet produced can be freely configured (see
          below).</para>
        <para>Semantic annotations are stored in the annotation list immediately after you select an
          authority entry, so you don't have to click anywhere else.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Batch edits and suggestions</emphasis></para>
        <para>It is not uncommon that the same person will be mentioned multiple times in a
          document. To simplify and speed up the editing process, the annotation editor tries to
          detect possible other occurrences of the currently selected entity throughout the
          document. A list of potential matches is presented at the bottom of the left
          sidebar.</para>
        <para>The list is compiled by traversing the text shown on screen, searching for strings
          which may indicate the same entity. The actual query depends on the information provided
          authority used: e.g. if the authority supplies alternative names, those will be added to
          the searched for strings.</para>
        <para>Each occurrence will show a checkbox to the left. Checking it will immediately tag the
          corresponding passage as another instance of the same entity. You can also check all boxes
          at once by clicking on the icon to the top right above the list.</para>
        <para>Moving your mouse over an entry will scroll the text to the corresponding occurrence,
          showing you the match in its context.</para>
        <para>Existing annotations referencing the same entity will also be shown in the list - with
          their checkbox checked. Sometimes you may also see an entry with red dots beneath,
          indicating that this is an existing annotation referencing a different entity, so
          considered a potential inconsistency to review. For example, if you selected the authority
          entry for "Ronald Reagan", you may see other occurrences of "Reagan", which have already
          been annotated as "Nancy Reagan". You will see those occurrences underlined with red dots.
          You can switch them to "Ronald Reagan" by checking their box.</para>
        <para>Unchecking a box will remove the existing annotation, e.g. incorrectly applied
          one.</para>

        <title>Toggle Annotations</title>
        <para>Toggle annotations are immediately applied when you click the annotation button. Since
          they do not require any further input they are just simply applied without much ado. Some
          good candidates might be titles or deletions. </para>
        <para>It is worth noting that it's not a textual phenomenon that constitutes a <emphasis>
            toggle</emphasis> annotation versus <emphasis>semantic</emphasis> or
            <emphasis>analytic</emphasis> in our simple category scheme. It is rather what kinds of
          detail a particular project decides to encode or not. Encoding of titles can be a
            <emphasis>toggle</emphasis> if we just decide to simply say that a text fragment is a
          title. It could become a <emphasis> semantic</emphasis> annotation if we'd like to
          associate it with a bibliographical reference or other detailed information. </para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Analytic and Text Critical Annotations</title>
        <para>These annotations are not connecting to an authority reference, but typically require
          further input to be made by the user. For example a <tag>date</tag> annotation requires
          the editor to supply a normalized date, while normalizations, abbreviations and
          corrections need regularized, expanded or corrected form, respectively. Apparatus entries
          will require all the variant readings. For all these annotations an input form will be
          shown into which such information can be entered. The exact content of the form depends on
          the annotation type.</para>
        <para>To store the annotation, you must click on the save button beneath the form after

      <title>Modifying Annotations</title>
      <para>The annotation view shows a colored line beneath the text spanned by each annotation.
        You can select text within an existing annotation or across multiple different ones and
        apply yet another annotation to it, thus resulting in <emphasis>nested
          annotations</emphasis>. However, the editor will ensure that you do not select partial
        elements, for example, a range of text followed by half of a <tag>persName</tag>. This would
        result in invalid XML, so the editor will automatically expand your selection to include the
        entire <tag>persName</tag>.</para>

        <title>Nested annotations</title>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>To the right of the annotated text, a colored box indicates the type of the annotation.
        The sequence of boxes also indicates how annotations are nested: the ones appearing to the
        right are wrapping those to the left. In the example above the "church of San Francisco" is
        a reference to a place, while "San Francisco" refers to a person, a patron saint of the
        church. The <tag>persName</tag> element is nested in the <tag>placeName</tag>.</para>
      <para>Click on the colored box to see details about the annotation. For semantic annotations,
        the details will include a summary of the entity drawn from the connected authority or the
        local TEI register. For analytic and text critical annotations, a table is shown, listing
        the corresponding attributes associated with the annotation.</para>

        confirmation.</para>
      <para>Clicking on the pen icon will open the annotation in the left sidebar, where you can
        change it. For semantic annotations, the authority lookup dialog will pop up automatically
        and you can change the connected authority entry by selecting a different one.</para>
      <para>Again, semantic annotations are applied immediately, while analytic and text critical

        bits of the base text are displayed and there's no hidden information, which would be
        inaccessible to the editor. The preview HTML panel simply uses the ODD associated with the
        document (or the base teipublisher.odd otherwise).</para>

      <title>Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <para>TEI Publisher 8 includes experimental support for detecting and tagging named entities in texts. The idea is to further simplify the work of editors when annotating documents via TEI Publisher’s web-based annotation editor by automatically identifying potential candidates for people, places etc.</para>
      <para>For named entity recognition to be available in the web-based annotation editor, a separate Python service
        is needed: clone the <link xlink:href="https://github.com/eeditiones/tei-publisher-ner">tei-publisher-ner</link> repository and follow the instructions in the README.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>One of the distinguishing features of this solution is that it makes it rather easy to train a recognition
        model on your own data sets. Head over to the <link xlink:href="https://www.e-editiones.org/posts/names-sell-named-entity-recognition-in-tei-publisher/">article on e-editiones</link> to read more about the service, how to use it, and how to train it.</para>

      <para>The HTML template defining the user interface of the annotations editor determines which
        authority is used for which annotation type and can be easily adjusted. Just edit the
          <filename> templates/pages/annotate.html</filename> file, which can be done in eXide (or
        any editor of your choice). A simple configuration looks as follows:</para>
      <programlisting language="xml" xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
<pb-authority-lookup subscribe="transcription" emit="transcription">
    <pb-authority connector="GND" name="organization" prefix="gnd"></pb-authority>

    <pb-authority connector="GND" name="person" prefix="gnd"></pb-authority>
</pb-authority-lookup>]]>
      </programlisting>
      <para>Each top-level pb-authority needs at least two attributes:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>a <option>name</option> indicating the annotation type for which it should be

              above</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>
      <para>In addition, you may define a <option>prefix</option>: this will be prepended to the
        xml:id referenced by the resulting TEI element (separated by a hyphen "-"). For example, you
        may want to prefix the numeric IDs received from GND with the prefix "gnd" to obtain an XML
        ID like "gnd-124507514" since a number alone would not be a valid @xml:id.</para>
      <para>Some connectors require additional configuration attributes. At the moment those are the
          <emphasis> GeoNames</emphasis>, <emphasis>Airtable</emphasis> and
          <emphasis>Reconciliation</emphasis> connectors. GeoNames requires you to register a user,
        whose name is given in the <option> user</option> attribute and Reconciliation requires that
        you specify a service URL.</para>
      <para>The <emphasis>Airtable</emphasis>, <emphasis>Reconciliation</emphasis> and <emphasis>
          Custom</emphasis> connectors are described in more detail below.</para>

          file as such, but rather a commercial online database, allowing users to define their own
          tables and forms. It can therefore be turned into an authority, e.g. by defining a
            <emphasis> people</emphasis> or <emphasis>places</emphasis> table and connecting it with
          the airtable connector. Since any kind of data can be stored in an airtable, a slightly
          more complex configuration is necessary to specify how to access relevant tables and
          extract the required information. An example configuration for a single table is shown
          below:</para>

        <para>Like the airtable connector described above, the <link
            xlink:href="https://reconciliation-api.github.io/specs/latest/">Reconciliation
            Service</link> is not really an authority file itself. Rather, it is a communication
          protocol for authority data providers originally developed for the open-source data
          cleaning software <link xlink:href="openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</link>. The specification
          is an open, <link xlink:href="https://www.w3.org/community/reconciliation/"
            >community-maintained</link> standard now, and several authority data providers offer
          comforming API endpoints. GeoNames, the German GND (again via lobid), Getty vocabularies
          and Wikidata are some examples - find a list of current services at the <link
            xlink:href="https://reconciliation-api.github.io/testbench/">service testbench</link>.
          In addition to the general attributes described above, the only additional bit of
          configuration is the service URL that should be queried. You specify it in the "endpoint"
          attribute:</para>
        <programlisting language="xml" xml:space="preserve">&lt;pb-authority connector="Reconciliation" name="term" prefix="wd" endpoint="https://wikidata.reconci.link/api"/></programlisting>
        <para>This will retrieve authority entries from wikidata.</para>
        <para>Currently, the Reconciliation connector cannot be used as a data provider for the
          Custom connector described below. This will be added in a future release.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Custom Connector</title>
        <para>The custom connector delegates queries to one or more authorities, but most
          importantly it creates a copy of every authority entry you select and writes it to a local
          TEI register.</para>
        <para>For many editions the information provided by an external authority will not be
          sufficient. It may be incomplete, in the sense it may lack important information relevant
          in the context of the edition but also many historical persons or places may not yet
          appear in any authority.</para>
        <para>Using the custom connector gives you a possibility to extend the information about an
          entity, or add new ones. This works as follows:<orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>whenever you select an entry from the external authority, the custom connector
                creates a skeleton <tag>person</tag>, <tag>place</tag> or <tag>category</tag> TEI
                element in the local TEI registry (the exact location of the registry can be
                configured) using the information provided by the authority</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>you can extend the local entry with additional information, e.g. add a note to

            </listitem>

        <para>This defines a custom connector for the annotation type 'person', delegating queries
          to the GND connector, but also maintaining a local registry. By default the local registry
          is stored in a TEI document residing in <filename>data/registry.xml</filename>. You can
          change the location by modifying the variable
            <varname>$anno:local-authority-file</varname> in the annotation configuration,
            <filename>modules/annotation-config.xqm</filename>. You can also change the function
            <function>anno:insert-point</function> to configure where exactly the local entity
          definitions will be stored.</para>
        <para>Currently, it is not possible to use the Reconciliation connector described above in
          the context of the Custom connector. This will be added in a future release.</para>

          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      <para>Let's assume we would like to support an annotation to tag foreign language passages
        with the TEI <tag>foreign</tag> element:</para>
      <para>First, open <filename>templates/pages/annotate.html</filename> in eXide and locate the
          <tag> div</tag> with class <option>toolbar</option>. This contains a list of <tag>
          paper-icon-button</tag> elements. Like many elements in TEI Publisher, <tag>
          paper-icon-button</tag> is a webcomponent from the polymer library, which renders a button
        compliant with Google's material design. You could use any other button-type element here,
        but for consistency, let's stick with <tag>paper-icon-button</tag>. We define our new button
        like this:</para>
      <programlisting>&lt;paper-icon-button class="annotation-action toggle" title="Foreign" data-type="foreign" icon="icons:language" data-shortcut="⌘+⇧+b,ctrl+⇧+b" disabled="disabled">&lt;/paper-icon-button></programlisting>

            <para>must at least contain <option>annotation-action</option>. The
                <option>toggle</option> indicates that this is a toggling annotation, which just
              switches between on and off and does not need further input. For semantic annotations
              you can also add <option> authority</option>, which would trigger the authority
              lookup.</para>

          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      <para>If you reload the annotation editor in the browser, you should now see your new button.
        However, TEI Publisher does not yet know how to translate the new annotation into actual TEI
        markup. To fix this, open <filename>modules/annotation-config.xqm</filename> and search for
        the function <function>anno:annotations</function>. This is a long switch statement with
        cases corresponding to the different annotation types. Add a new case to the top:</para>
      <programlisting>declare function anno:annotations($type as xs:string, $properties as map(*), $content as function(*)) {
    switch ($type)
        case "foreign" return
            &lt;foreign xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">{$content()}&lt;/foreign>
    ...
};</programlisting>
      <para>This will simply wrap a <tag>foreign</tag> tag around the existing content. Note that
          <parameter> $content</parameter> is passed in as a function pointer, so it is important to
        call it as <code> $content()</code>. Also note how we need to declare the TEI namespace.
        Without this namespace declaration, the element would not be recognized as TEI.</para>
      <para>Now we can try our new annotation: select a passage, click on the button and see how the
        text is marked as an annotation. The color is chosen automatically. You can also check in
        the TEI preview pane that the annotation is correctly output as a TEI <tag>foreign</tag>
        element.</para>
      <para>However, if you save the annotations, you'll notice that - once the annotation view
        refreshes - the foreign text is rendered in italics, but not marked as an annotation! To fix
        this, we need to modify the ODD used for rendering the annotation view.</para>
      <para>Open <filename>odd/annotations.odd</filename> (named "Annotations"), either in eXide or
        the ODD editor. Add an <tag>elementSpec</tag> for element <tag>foreign</tag> with an inline
        model and a <option>cssClass</option> containing <code>annotation
        annotation-foreign</code>.</para>
      <programlisting>&lt;elementSpec ident="foreign" mode="change">
    &lt;model behaviour="inline" cssClass="annotation annotation-foreign"/>
&lt;/elementSpec></programlisting>
      <para>If you like, you can also keep the <tag>outputRendition</tag>, which renders the text in
        italic. Key is that you declare the two <emphasis>annotation annotation-foreign</emphasis>
        CSS classes, because those will tell TEI Publisher that the element should be treated as an
        annotation.</para>
      <para>As a general guideline, the ODD rules for annotations should produce simple inline tags.
        They should output the content of the element without any modification. They may use <tag>
          outputRendition</tag> to change the appearance, or supply other parameters (than <option>
          content</option>).</para>
      <para>After saving the ODD, reloading the annotation editor should properly display the <tag>
          foreign</tag> as an annotation and we can start using our new annotation type.</para>
      <para>However, we may not be entirely happy with the simple on/off toggle: it would be much
        better if we could also indicate the used language in <tag>foreign</tag>. This means we have
        to change our annotation from a mere toggle into one which can take an additional
        parameter:</para>
      <para>To achieve this, go back to <filename>templates/pages/annotate.html</filename> and
        remove the <option>toggle</option> class from the <tag>paper-icon-button</tag>:</para>
      <programlisting>&lt;paper-icon-button class="annotation-action" title="Foreign" data-type="foreign" icon="icons:language" data-shortcut="⌘+⇧+b,ctrl+⇧+b" disabled="disabled">&lt;/paper-icon-button></programlisting>
      <para>We would also like to provide an input field into which the user can enter the language.
        Scroll down to where the <tag>form</tag> is defined and add another input on top:</para>
      <programlisting>&lt;iron-form id="edit-form">
    &lt;form action="">
        &lt;paper-input class="annotation-form foreign" name="lang" label="Language">&lt;/paper-input>
    ...
&lt;/iron-form></programlisting>
      <para>Again we're using a webcomponent for the input to get the material design look and feel.
        The class attribute is particularly important: it must always contain <option>
          annotation-form</option>, followed by the annotation type: <option>foreign</option>. The
        name is arbitrary, but should be unique and we need to remember it for later. The label
        should contain a short title, which will be shown next to the input.</para>
      <para>Finally, we need to change our rule in
          <filename>modules/annotation-config.xqm</filename> to add the new parameter to the
        generated <tag>foreign</tag> element. Navigate to the file and change the
          <function>anno:annotations</function> function as follows:</para>
      <programlisting>declare function anno:annotations($type as xs:string, $properties as map(*), $content as function(*)) {
    switch ($type)
        case "foreign" return
            &lt;foreign xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:lang="{$properties?lang}">{$content()}&lt;/foreign>
    ...
};</programlisting>
      <para>The function receives all the parameters entered into the form fields in the <varname>
          $properties</varname> map. In the form we used <code>name="lang"</code>, so the
        corresponding value is retrieved from the map with <code>$properties?lang</code>.</para>
      <para>That's all. You should now be able to modify your existing foreign annotation, enter a
        language and see how it is output into TEI.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Other Considerations</title>
      <para>Web annotations require a clear mapping between the HTML view of the text in the browser
        and the TEI document in the database. It is thus important to respect the following
        restrictions:</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>TEI Publisher's page-by-page display of a text will not work in the annotation
            editor</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Likewise, the <option>fill</option> parameter, which causes TEI Publisher to fill up
            short fragments with content from nested divs, should be set to 0 for annotation
            purposes.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The annotation editor can operate on documents with multiple division and will show
            them one after the other. However, those need to be top-level divisions. Therefore the
              <option> depth</option> parameter should be set to 1.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>To ensure this, TEI Publisher sets the following configuration for the annotate
        collection in <filename>config.xqm</filename>:</para>
      <programlisting language="xquery">declare function config:collection-config($collection as xs:string?, $docUri as xs:string?) {
    switch ($collection)
        (: For annotations we need to overwrite document-specific settings :)
        case "annotate" return
            map {
                "template": "annotate.html",
                "overwrite": true(),
                "depth": 1,
                "fill": 0
            }
        default return
            (: Return empty sequence to use default config :)
            ()
};</programlisting>
      <para>Generated applications should choose similar settings. If you create a separate app just
        for annotations, the following function would suffice to impose the right settings for all
        documents:</para>
      <programlisting language="xquery">declare function config:collection-config($collection as xs:string?, $docUri as xs:string?) {
    map {
        "template": "annotate.html",
        "overwrite": true(),
        "depth": 1,
        "fill": 0
    }
};</programlisting>

    <para>Regardless of the installation type, TEI Publisher always runs on an <link

      few things to keep in mind for a production system, i.e. one that is publicly available to

        >Production Use - Good Practice</link> of the eXist-db documentation. One important point is
      to always run eXist-db in production behind a proxy server, which serves as an intermediary to
      control and protect access to a server on which the database runs.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Running behind a proxy</title>
      <para>To set up a proxy, we suggest looking at the docker compose configuration we provide. It includes
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/eeditiones/teipublisher-docker-compose/tree/master/conf">configuration templates</link> for the nginx proxy. More general information about
        proxy servers and eXist-db can be found in the article <link xlink:show="new"

      <para>What does a proxy do for you? It can:</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>handle domains and protect parts of the database you don't want external users to access. For example, you can
            access the Escher edition using its <link xlink:href="https://www.briefedition.alfred-escher.ch/">public URL</link> and
            you will directly land on the home page of the edition. What you can't see is that the Escher is just one out of several editions hosted
            within the same eXist database. It is the proxy's job to direct you to the correct application
            matching the public URL, so it appears to you as if there were only one edition. Other editions in the same

      </orderedlist>
      <para>In the following sections we'll discuss specific settings you should pay attention to when running TEI
        Publisher behind a proxy.</para>
      <section>
        <title>Context paths</title>
      <para>If you would like the proxy to directly route traffic for a public URL to a specific application within
        eXist, you also need to make sure that all internal application links are correctly set, depending
        on the context in which the app operates. The link to "Start" (i.e. the home page of the edition) in the menu would be an
        example. While you are developing the app, you want this link to point to
        <code>/exist/apps/my-edition/</code> (we call this the <emphasis>context path</emphasis>).
        When deploying the app to production (i.e. behind a proxy), this link should change and just point to
        the root of the host. The context path should therefore be empty.</para>
      <para>TEI Publisher based apps allow developers to control
        this behaviour via a special variable in <code>modules/config.xqm</code> called
        <code>$config:context-path</code>.</para>
      <para>The default setting for <code>$config:context-path</code> is determined as follows:</para>
      <procedure>
        <step>
          <para>if a Java system property called <code>teipublisher.context-path</code> is set, use its value as context
          path</para>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>otherwise look at the HTTP request header <code>X-Forwarded-Host</code> and if present, assume that
            we're running behind a proxy and the context path should be empty</para>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>finally, try to determine the context path by checking the install location of the application within
            eXist. This will lead to a context path like <code>/exist/apps/my-edition/</code></para>
        </step>
      </procedure>
      <para>This procedure should work for most cases, so manually adjusting <code>$config:context-path</code> should
        rarely be necessary.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Caching</title>
        <para>While you can use a proxy to cache arbitrary contents based on timeouts and cache expiration, TEI
          Publisher 8 includes some support for a more intelligent caching approach: if enabled, TEI Publisher will
          answer to the <code>If-Modified-Since</code> HTTP header sent by the proxy. If any of the resources targetted
          by the request have been modified since the given timestamp, TEI Publisher will process the request as usual.
          However, if it finds that no modifications were applied in the meantime, it simply returns a 304 response
          code, telling the proxy that it can safely use its cached version.</para>
        <para>To enable this feature, set the variable <code>$config:enable-proxy-caching</code> to true.</para>
        <note>
          <para>At the time of writing, only the most important API calls in TEI Publisher support
            <code>If-Modified-Since</code>. Those include the API call for displaying a single page or division, which
            is the most frequently called operation.</para>

      <title>Hosting</title>
      <para>Where and how to host a custom edition built with TEI Publisher is one of the most frequent questions we
        receive. Fortunately there are various options and we're doing our best to help academic users by providing
        various tools to simplify the task, as well as cooperating with providers.</para>
      <para>Some options are:</para>

          <term>dedicated server</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>means a physical or virtual machine on which eXist-db, TEI Publisher and a proxy server can be
              installed and configured. Many academic providers and
              research infrastructures (e.g. Huma-Num) routinely support dedicated eXist-db and TEI Publisher
              installations while others can do so upon request.</para>

              configuration for your own custom edition.</para>
            <para>To use this option you need to find a hosting provider, which supports running a dockerized
              architecture with <emphasis>docker compose</emphasis> (just search for a virtual cloud server with docker
              preinstalled). Fortunately this is quite common and - unless you intend to
              run a heavy duty service – the costs are very acceptable. With this option,
              rebuilding the entire setup is quick and easy, which makes it the perfect solution for sites still being
              under development. On the downside, performance may not be as good as with a dedicated server, but it is

              set of static HTML pages and helper files. The generated files can be hosted on any web server, including
              free services like GitHub Pages. It is a particularly fitting solution for smaller editions without extensive
              search features. The article <link xlink:show="new"

                high voltage site by going static</link> describes how such a static site can be generated
              and discusses in detail the advantages and drawbacks of this solution.</para>

      <title>Web components</title>
      <para>By default TEI Publisher and apps generated from it load the user interface components from a global CDN
        (content delivery network). For a long time this was the generally recommended approach. CDNs promised
        reliability and fast, globally distributed access to resources. Web browsers can cache those resources
        efficiently across applications.</para>
      <para>However, we recently experienced more and more difficulties with some CDN, in particular the one used by TEI
      Publisher by default. As a result, pages may appear inaccessible or slow to users, even though TEI Publisher itself is
      responsive and fast.</para>
      <para>For production deployments we therefore recommend to consider self-hosting the required component libraries.
        This means: all javascript libraries are downloaded and bundled with your custom application. The build scripts
        shipped with TEI Publisher and generated apps make this rather easy. The necessary steps are as follows:</para>
      <procedure>
        <step>
          <para>make sure you have <link xlink:href="https://nodejs.org">nodejs</link> with npm
            installed; also check if the build property <code>npm</code> in your
            <code>build.xml</code> (for generated apps) or <code>build.properties</code> (TEI Publisher app) points to
            the npm binary.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>edit <filename>modules/config.xqm</filename> and change the value of variable
            <code>$config:webcomponents</code> to "local":</para>
          <synopsis language="xquery">declare variable $config:webcomponents := "local";</synopsis>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>build your application package with the command <code>ant xar-local</code> (instead of just calling
            ant) and deploy as usual</para>
        </step>
      </procedure>
